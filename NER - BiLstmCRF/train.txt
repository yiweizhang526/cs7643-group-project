you B-PER:Individual

" O
less O

fewer O

fresh O

the O
repetitiveness O
of O
the O
old O
arguments O
became O
tiresome O

" O

" O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
becoming O
almost O
as O
cynical O
as O
my B-PER:Group
constituents I-PER:Group

I B-PER:Individual
knew O
it O
was O
time O
to O
leave O

" O

Is O
n't O
that O
a O
great O
argument O
for O
term O
limits O
? O

I B-PER:Individual
know O
very B-PER:Group
few I-PER:Group
senators I-PER:Group
or I-PER:Group
any I-PER:Group
who I-PER:Group
are I-PER:Group
as I-PER:Group
good I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
their I-PER:Group
third I-PER:Group

first I-PER:Group

Should O

we B-GPE:Nation

First O
of O

that O

I B-PER:Individual
must O
say O

that O

it O
has O
nothing O
do O

in O
my B-PER:Individual
opinion O

think O

the O

, O
right O
next O

to O
where O
Bob B-PER:Individual
was O
reading O

This O
struck O
me B-PER:Individual
because O
you B-PER:Individual
've O
got O
the O
courage O
to O
say O
something O
that O
is O
heretical O
today O

it O

You B-PER:Individual
say O

" O
Partisanship O

taken O
on O
an O
odious O
connotation O

and O
it O
may O
indeed O
be O
shriller O
now O
than O
ever O

But O
we B-GPE:Nation

lose O

of O
the O
fact O
that O
we B-GPE:Nation
have O
two B-ORG:Non-Governmental

so O
people B-PER:Group
will O
have O
choices O

it B-GPE:Nation
might O
be O
a B-GPE:Nation
tranquil I-GPE:Nation

it B-GPE:Nation

a O

You B-PER:Indeterminate

They B-PER:Group
certainly O

to O
the O
Republican B-ORG:Non-Governmental
message O

" O

That O
's O
a O
good O
future O
for O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
Democratic I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Party I-ORG:Non-Governmental
in O
the B-LOC:Region-General
South I-LOC:Region-General
. I-LOC:Region-General

Bob B-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
the O
reason O
everybody B-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
south I-PER:Group
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
we B-PER:Group
were O
-- O
when O
Franklin B-PER:Individual
Roosevelt I-PER:Individual
was O
elected O
president B-Job-Title
, I-Job-Title
we B-PER:Group
had O
been O
living O
what B-LOC:Region-General
we B-PER:Group
thought O
was O
still O
a B-LOC:Region-General
conquered I-LOC:Region-General
nation I-LOC:Region-General
after O
the O
Civil O
War O
. O

And O
we B-PER:Group
felt O
that O
Franklin B-PER:Individual
Roosevelt I-PER:Individual
was O
the B-PER:Individual
first I-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
ever I-PER:Individual
really I-PER:Individual
acknowledged I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
South I-PER:Individual
had I-PER:Individual
peculiar I-PER:Individual
problems I-PER:Individual
. I-PER:Individual

And O
from O
that O
time O
on O
, O
that O
's O
the O
reason O
we B-PER:Group
had O
22 B-PER:Group
Democratic I-PER:Group
senators I-PER:Group
from O
11 B-GPE:State-or-Province
confederate I-GPE:State-or-Province
states I-GPE:State-or-Province
, I-GPE:State-or-Province
is O
because O
of O
the O
Civil O
War O
and O
because O
of O
what O
we B-PER:Group
thought O
was O
a O
heavy O
hand O
of O
the B-ORG:Government
federal I-ORG:Government
government I-ORG:Government
all O
the O
time O
. O

Of O
course O
there O
was O
always O
that O
old O
story O
about O
the B-PER:Group
Yankees I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
and O
Yankees B-PER:Group
were O
synonymous O
with O
Republicans B-ORG:Non-Governmental
. I-ORG:Non-Governmental

But O
that O
's O
all O
changed O
and O
memories O
have O
dimmed O
. O

And O
people B-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
they B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
remember O
that O
. O

And O
so O
the O
message O
, O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
Republicans I-ORG:Non-Governmental
have O
actually O
had O
a O
golden O
opportunity O
to O
make O
their B-ORG:Non-Governmental
case O
and O
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental
've O
done O
it O
successfully O
. O

And O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
Democrats I-ORG:Non-Governmental
need O
desperately O
to O
get O
a O
message O
to O
counter O
that O
, O
and O
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental
need O
to O
get O
a O
message O
and O
stay O
on O
it O
. O

I B-PER:Individual

we B-ORG:Non-Governmental
can O
not O
be O
all O

But O
I B-PER:Individual
'll O
tell O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
the O
message O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental

ought O
to O

thousands I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
Iraqi I-PER:Group
women I-PER:Group

unnecessarily O

, O
what O
should O
we B-GPE:Nation

? O

The O
answer O
is O
, O
these B-PER:Group
are O
my B-PER:Group
neighbors I-PER:Group
from I-PER:Group
Vermont I-PER:Group

obviously O
we B-GPE:Nation

And O
obviously O
we B-GPE:Nation

The B-PER:Individual
president I-PER:Individual
almost O

this O

the O
reason O
that O

NOVAK B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
want O
to O

point O

But O
the O
problem O
with O

was O
that O
the B-PER:Individual
guy I-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
he I-PER:Individual
overthrew I-PER:Individual
was O
put O

power O
by O
the B-GPE:Nation

I B-PER:Individual
ca O
n't O
quite O
figure O
that O
out O

We B-GPE:Nation

and O
put O
the B-Job-Title
Shah I-Job-Title

But O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
you B-PER:Individual
're O
attacking O
the B-ORG:Government

for O
putting O
him B-PER:Individual
in O
, O
when O
it O
was O
-- O
the O
problem O
was O

No O
, O
the O
point O
I B-PER:Individual
made O

Khomeini B-PER:Individual

And O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
curious O

how O
can O
Democrats B-PER:Group
claim O
that O
President B-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual

still O

no O
, O
here O

why O

This O
is O
a O
serious O
point O
and O
you B-PER:Individual
deserve O
a O
serious O
answer O

The O
way O
we B-GPE:Nation
caught O
that B-PER:Individual

was O
by O
coordinating O

We B-GPE:Nation
now O

, I-PER:Individual
thanks O
for O
stying O
with O
us B-ORG:Media
through O
the O
break O
. O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O
that O
we B-ORG:Media
like O
having O
you B-PER:Individual
on O
, O
and O
as O
well O
as O
Mr. B-PER:Individual
Rangel I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
is O
that O
, O
you B-PER:Individual
know O
, O
this O
is O
war O
, O
as O
we B-PER:Group
were O
saying O
in O
the O
last O
segment O
. O

You B-PER:Individual
treat O
it O
with O
the O
gravity O
and O
the O
seriousness O
that O
it O
deserves O
. O

And O
you B-PER:Individual
're O
a B-PER:Individual
congressman I-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
has I-PER:Individual
put I-PER:Individual
his I-PER:Individual
constituents I-PER:Individual
and I-PER:Individual
his I-PER:Individual
country I-PER:Individual
ahead I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
his I-PER:Individual
partisan I-PER:Individual
interests I-PER:Individual
. I-PER:Individual

So O
I B-PER:Individual
wonder O
if O
you B-PER:Individual
'll O
join O
Charlie B-PER:Individual
Rangel I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
who B-PER:Individual
put O
out O
a O
press O
release O
today O
, O
decrying O
the O
Republican B-ORG:Non-Governmental
attempt O
to O
hijack O
a O
bill O
to O
help O
our B-PER:Group
servicemen I-PER:Group
to O
use O
it O
to O
give O
special O
interest O
tax O
breaks O
to O
corporations B-ORG:Commercial
. I-ORG:Commercial

Is O
n't O
that O
wrong O
in O
a O
time O
of O
war O
? O

The O
important O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
bill O
pass O
for O
the B-ORG:Government
military I-ORG:Government
. I-ORG:Government

If O
the O
other O
stuff O
's O
in O
there O
, O
it O
's O
there O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
the O
main O
purpose O
should O
be O
the B-ORG:Government
military I-ORG:Government
. I-ORG:Government

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
going O
to O
disagree O
with O
Charlie B-PER:Individual
's O
point O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
often O
when O
bills O
are O
passed O
, O
there O
are O
things O
attached O
to O
them O
. O

So O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
the O
key O
thing O
is O
that O
we B-GPE:Nation
ought O
to O
be O
taking O
care O
of O
the B-ORG:Government
military I-ORG:Government
and O
that O
's O
what O
we B-GPE:Nation
should O
do O
. O

If O

they B-PER:Group

But O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
the O
main O
thing O
that O
we B-GPE:Nation

now O
is O
we B-GPE:Nation
should O
concentrate O
on O
Osama B-PER:Individual

we B-GPE:Nation
should O
concentrate O
on O
dismantling O
Saddam B-PER:Individual

We B-GPE:Nation
should O
do O
all O
of O
those O
things O
, O
but O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
we B-GPE:Nation
should O
not O
have O
the O
arrogance O
to O
have O
a O
preemptive O
strike O
against O
a B-GPE:Nation
defenseless I-GPE:Nation

It O
was O
our B-GPE:Nation

they B-GPE:Nation

They B-GPE:Nation

it B-WEA:Underspecified

we B-GPE:Nation
supported O
them B-GPE:Nation
having O
it B-WEA:Underspecified
when O
they B-GPE:Nation
were O
fighting O
Iran B-GPE:Nation
so O
it O
's O
no O
big O
deal O
there O

And O
the O
thing O
is O
that O
if O
we B-GPE:Nation
can O
disarm O
them B-GPE:Nation
without O
actually O
going O
there B-GPE:Nation
, I-GPE:Nation
killing O

that B-PER:Group

dangerous B-WEA:Underspecified

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
what O
happens O
if O

decides O
that O
they B-GPE:Nation
could O
have O
a O
preemptive O
strike O

What O
happens O
if O
the B-GPE:Nation
North I-GPE:Nation

take O

Our B-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation

great O
enough O

strong O
enough O

the B-GPE:Nation

reason O
that O
France B-GPE:Nation

My B-PER:Individual

Christina B-PER:Individual
Wright I-PER:Individual

ph O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
just O
curious O
if O
you B-PER:Group
feel O
that O
the O
attack O
on O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
would O
actually O
open O
a O
Pandora O

box O
in O
other B-GPE:Nation
Middle I-GPE:Nation
Eastern I-GPE:Nation
countries I-GPE:Nation
that B-GPE:Nation
we B-PER:Group
are O
known O
to O
aid O
and O
harbor O
terrorists B-PER:Group

such O
as O
Syria B-GPE:Nation

Iran B-GPE:Nation

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
that O

absolutely O
one O
of O
the O
fears O

That O
it O
would O
destabilize O
the B-LOC:Region-International

the O

the B-LOC:Region-International

the O
question O

could O
it O

worse O

it O

more O
likely O
that O
this B-LOC:Region-International
very I-LOC:Region-International
unstable I-LOC:Region-International
region I-LOC:Region-International
could O
cause O

decided O
to O
not O
back O
a O
second O
resolution O
, O
who B-GPE:Nation
is O
not O
( O
UNINTELLIGIBLE O
) O
? O

Is O
it O
the B-GPE:Nation
U.S. I-GPE:Nation
or O
is O
it O

It B-GPE:GPE-Cluster
's O
actually O
Western B-GPE:GPE-Cluster
Europe I-GPE:GPE-Cluster

are O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation

that O

had O

take O

He B-PER:Individual
said O
this O
long O
before O

ever O

. O

He B-PER:Individual
reiterated O
today O
in O
a O
press B-ORG:Media
conference O
in O
Baghdad B-GPE:Population-Center
that O
this O
would O
just O
be O
the O
beginning O
of O
this O
that O
they B-PER:Group
would O
plan O
on O
killing O
thousands B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
U.S. I-PER:Group
troops I-PER:Group
with O

similar O
to O
this O

Also O
, O
in O
southern B-LOC:Region-General
Iraq I-LOC:Region-General
today O
near O
Basra B-GPE:Population-Center
, I-GPE:Population-Center
two B-PER:Group

Saddam I-PER:Group

Thataeen I-PER:Group
( I-PER:Group
ph I-PER:Group
) I-PER:Group
group I-PER:Group
surrendered O
to O
U.S. B-PER:Group
troops I-PER:Group
saying O
that O
they B-PER:Group
had O
been O
ordered O
to O
carry O
out O
suicide O
bombings O
down B-LOC:Region-General
there I-LOC:Region-General
but O
that O
they B-PER:Group
did O
n't O
want O
to O
die O
for O
the B-ORG:Government
regime I-ORG:Government
so O
they B-PER:Group
were O
surrendering O
. O

At O
the O
Pentagon B-ORG:Government
briefing O
today O
, O
General B-PER:Individual
Stanley I-PER:Individual
McChrystal I-PER:Individual
said O
that O
it O
looked O
a O
lot O
like O
terrorism O
. O

It O
looks O
and O
feels O
like O
terrorism O
and O
what O
it O
requires O
is O
units B-PER:Group
to O
conduct O
forced O
production O
activities O
which O
they B-PER:Group
are O
prepared O
and O
do O
all O
the O
time O
but O
clearly O
when O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
see O
a O
tactic O
like O
this O
, O
it O
requires O
strict O
adherence O
or O
adjustments O
to O
your B-PER:Indeterminate
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
to O
ensure O
that O
places B-LOC:Region-General
like I-LOC:Region-General
checkpoints I-LOC:Region-General
are O
not O
vulnerable O
. O

So O
it O
wo O
n't O
change O
our B-ORG:Government
overall O
rules O
of O
engagement O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
effect O
the O
operation O
at O
large O
but O
to O
protect O
our B-PER:Group
soldiers I-PER:Group
it O
clearly O
requires O
great O
care O
. O

So O
certainly O
an O
unpleasant O
development O
today O
Judy B-PER:Individual
and O
another O
item O
on O
the O
docket O
over O
here B-GPE:Nation
today O
is O
the O

The B-ORG:Government

says O
a B-WEA:Exploding
total I-WEA:Exploding
of I-WEA:Exploding
seven I-WEA:Exploding
of I-WEA:Exploding
the I-WEA:Exploding
cruise I-WEA:Exploding

The B-WEA:Projectile

that O
they B-WEA:Projectile
do O
n't O
detonate O
until O
they B-WEA:Projectile
reach O
their B-WEA:Projectile

. O

If O
they B-WEA:Projectile
go O
astray O
, O
then O
the B-WEA:Exploding

never O
arm O
but O
claiming O
that O
it O

about O
one B-WEA:Exploding

PLANTE B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
no O
major O
concern O
. O

The B-ORG:Government
Pentagon I-ORG:Government
says O
that O
they B-ORG:Government
do O
have O
air O
dominance O
as O
they B-ORG:Government
now O
call O
it O
over O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the B-GPE:Nation

that O
there O

The O
reason O
that O
they O
're O

according O
to O
today O

was O
that O
they B-PER:Group

great O

of O
U.S. B-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
British I-PER:Group
forces I-PER:Group
now O
, O
Judy B-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
which O
is O
that O
they B-PER:Group
're O
superbly B-PER:Group
trained I-PER:Group
troops I-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

They B-PER:Group
have O
training O
in O
a O
whole O
variety O
of O
different O
missions O
and O
they B-PER:Group
're O
adapting O
. O

They B-PER:Group
recognize O
now O
they B-PER:Group
went O
in O
with O
some O
false O
assumptions O
about O
the O
kind O
of O
reception O
that O
they B-PER:Group
were O
going O
to O
face O
. O

The O
plan O
that O
was O
implemented O
had O
some O
inherent O
risks O
in O
it O
, O
risks O
to O
the B-FAC:Path
supply I-FAC:Path
line I-FAC:Path
, I-FAC:Path
risks O
in O
terms O
of O
not O
clearing O
cities B-GPE:Population-Center
and O
they B-PER:Group
're O
shifting O
. O

They B-PER:Group
're O
changing O
and O
the B-PER:Group
troops I-PER:Group
are O
trained O
well O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
deal O
with O
that O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
've O
seen O
U.S. B-ORG:Government
Central I-ORG:Government
Command I-ORG:Government
bringing O
up O
additional B-PER:Group
forces I-PER:Group
like I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
82nd I-PER:Group
Airborne I-PER:Group
Division I-PER:Group
to O
better O
deal O
with O
these B-FAC:Path
long I-FAC:Path
supply I-FAC:Path
lines I-FAC:Path
, I-FAC:Path
get O
control O
over O
the B-GPE:Population-Center
cities I-GPE:Population-Center
and O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
U.S. B-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
British I-PER:Group
forces I-PER:Group
are O
beginning O
to O
stabilize O
the O
battlefield O
. O

So O
as O
an B-PER:Individual
onlooker I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
as O
somebody B-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
's I-PER:Individual
studied I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
Iraqi I-PER:Individual
capabilities I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
is O
it O
your B-PER:Individual
sense O
that O
the B-GPE:Nation
coalition I-GPE:Nation
can O
continue O
to O
adjust O
to O
whatever O
they B-GPE:Nation
deal O
with O
? O

One O
of O
the O
things O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
we B-PER:Group
're O
likely O
to O
see O
is O
that O
the B-PER:Group
Iraqis I-PER:Group
are O
going O
to O
have O
a O
tougher O
time O
adapting O
than O
U.S. B-PER:Group
forces I-PER:Group
are O
. O

Typically O
what O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
've O
seen O
in O
the B-PER:Group
Iraqi I-PER:Group
armed I-PER:Group
forces I-PER:Group
is O
the O
change O
has O
to O
come O
from O
the O
top O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
come O
from O
the O
ground O
up O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
do O
n't O
have O
ground B-PER:Group
commanders I-PER:Group
calling O
back O
and O
saying O
hey O
, O
we B-PER:Group
'd O
like O
to O
try O
this O
tactic O
or O
this O
seems O
to O
work O
. O

Tell O
everybody B-PER:Group
else I-PER:Group
to O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Instead O
the B-PER:Group
high I-PER:Group
command I-PER:Group
has O
to O
identify O
a O
problem O
, O
come O
up O
with O
a O
solution O
and O
transmit O
it O
down O
. O

Chances O
are O
the B-PER:Group
Iraqis I-PER:Group
are O
going O
to O
continue O
to O
stick O
with O
what O
we B-PER:Group
've O
seen O
before O
, O
irregular B-PER:Group
forces I-PER:Group
blending O
in O
with O
civilians B-PER:Group
trying O
to O
attack O
U.S. B-PER:Group
forces I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
some O
more O
of O
these O
suicide O
attacks O
which O
are O
going O
to O
be O
problematic O
for O
our B-PER:Group
troops I-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

There O
's O
no O
way O
around O
that O
but O
U.S. B-PER:Group
forces I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
British B-PER:Group
forces I-PER:Group
are O
beginning O
to O
adapt O
to O
it O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
want O
to O
ask O
you B-PER:Individual
about O
you B-PER:Individual
mentioned O
coalition B-PER:Group
forces I-PER:Group
going O
in O
expecting O
more O
support O
from O
ordinary B-PER:Group
Iraqi I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

I B-PER:Individual
just O
interviewed O
a B-PER:Individual
gentleman I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
native B-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
Iraq I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
who B-PER:Individual
talks O
to O
his B-PER:Group
family I-PER:Group
there B-GPE:Nation
all O
the O
time O
and O
he B-PER:Individual
says O
they B-PER:Group
live O
in O
Baghdad B-GPE:Population-Center
20 B-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
30 I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
50 I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
them I-PER:Group
and O
he B-PER:Individual
said O
they B-PER:Group
do O
the O
view O
the B-PER:Group
Americans I-PER:Group
as O
invaders B-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

They B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
like O
what O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
doing O
but O
they B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
think O
the B-PER:Group
Americans I-PER:Group
are O
the O
answer O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
is O
something O
that O
we B-PER:Group
've O
been O
trying O
to O
get O
a O
grip O
on O
for O
years O
, O
exactly O
what O
the B-GPE:Nation
Iraqi I-GPE:Nation
people I-GPE:Nation
feel O
and O
also O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
the O
best O
evidence O
that O
we B-PER:Group
had O
before O
the O
attack O
began O
was O
that O
Iraqis B-GPE:Nation
do O
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
despise O
. O

They B-GPE:Nation
are O
desperate O
to O
be O
rid O
of O
him B-PER:Individual
but O
by O
the O
same O
token O
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
do O
n't O
like O
another B-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation
coming O
into O
their B-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation
to O
overturn O
the B-GPE:Nation
government I-GPE:Nation
and O
beyond O
that O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
probably O
most O
important O
for O
most B-PER:Group
Iraqis I-PER:Group
is O
they B-PER:Group
're O
deeply O
suspicious O
of O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
. I-GPE:Nation

They B-PER:Group
remember O
that O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
betrayed O
them B-PER:Group
in O
1991 O
. O

The B-GPE:Nation
U.S. I-GPE:Nation
did O
n't O
finish O
Saddam B-PER:Individual
then O
. O

President B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
- O
then O
President B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
called O
on O
them B-PER:Group
to O
rise O
up O
and O
then O
the B-GPE:Nation
U.S. I-GPE:Nation
did O
nothing O
and O
so O
they B-PER:Group
're O
deeply O
suspicious O
of O
what O
we B-GPE:Nation
have O
in O
mind O
. O

WOODRUFF B-PER:Individual
Which O
raises O
questions O
going O
forward O
. O

One O
last O
thing O
, O
Ken B-PER:Individual
Pollack I-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
want O
to O
ask O
about O
this O
British B-PER:Group
officials I-PER:Group
saying O
that O
they B-PER:Group
have O
information O
that O
Saddam B-PER:Individual
Hussein I-PER:Individual
has O
fired O
his B-PER:Individual
air I-PER:Individual
defense I-PER:Individual
chief I-PER:Individual
. I-PER:Individual

What O
's O
the O
significance O
of O
that O
? O

Well O
, O
if O
it O
's O
true O
and O
obviously O
we B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
know O
just O
yet O
but O
if O
it O
's O
true O
, O
it O
is O
very O
significant O
because O
it O
's O
effectively O
the B-GPE:Nation
Iraqis I-GPE:Nation
admitting O
that O
many O
of O
the O
civilian B-PER:Group
casualties O
that O
we B-PER:Group
've O
seen O
over O
the O
last O
few O
days O
may O
in O
fact O
have O
been O
caused O
by O
Iraqi B-WEA:Exploding
surface I-WEA:Exploding
to I-WEA:Exploding
air I-WEA:Exploding
missiles I-WEA:Exploding
falling O
back O
to O
ground O
in O
residential B-LOC:Region-General
areas I-LOC:Region-General
. I-LOC:Region-General

Exactly O
, O
in O
that B-FAC:Building-Grounds
market I-FAC:Building-Grounds
and O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
was O
pretty O
apparent O
when O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
looked O
at O
the O
video O
of O
that B-FAC:Building-Grounds
market I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, I-FAC:Building-Grounds
if O
that O
had O
been O
a B-WEA:Exploding
U.S. I-WEA:Exploding
bomb I-WEA:Exploding
or O
a B-WEA:Exploding
U.S. I-WEA:Exploding
cruise I-WEA:Exploding
missile I-WEA:Exploding
, I-WEA:Exploding
that B-FAC:Building-Grounds
market I-FAC:Building-Grounds
would O
have O
been O
obliterated O
. O

Chances O
are O
it B-WEA:Projectile
was O
an B-WEA:Projectile

surface I-WEA:Projectile

basically O
for O
the O

we B-PER:Group
've O
been O
watching O

Five O

that O
in O

also O

some O
massive O

it O
appears O
that O
this O
bombing O
in O
this O

continues O
and O
we B-PER:Group
have O
really O
seen O
the O
most O
intense O

is O

is O
on O

that O
the B-PER:Group

WEDEMAN B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
basically O
on O
the B-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
ridge I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
itself I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
it B-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
is I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
the I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
most I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
forward I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
Iraqi I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
army I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
positions I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
and O
we B-PER:Group
've O
been O
watching O
them B-PER:Group
very O
closely O
for O
the O
last O
month O
prior O
to O
the O
war O
to O
the O
outbreak O
of O
the O
war O
and O
basically O
these O
are O
the O
positions O
that O
control O
this B-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
entire I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
valley I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
. I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural

Up O
there O
they B-PER:Group
have O
heavy B-WEA:Shooting

They B-PER:Group
have O
anti-tank B-WEA:Shooting

along I-PER:Group
this I-PER:Group
very I-PER:Group

that I-PER:Group
basically I-PER:Group
runs I-PER:Group
from I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
north I-PER:Group
to I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
south I-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

In O
addition O
to O
that O
, O
we B-PER:Group
know O
that O
further O
back O
behind O
those O
lines O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Mosul B-GPE:Population-Center
there O
is O
heavy B-WEA:Shooting
artillery I-WEA:Shooting
and O
tanks B-VEH:Land
as O
well O
, O
this O
according O
to O
the B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
here I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
this I-PER:Group

the B-PER:Group

been O
going O

Now O
precisely O
what O
they B-PER:Group
're O
hitting O
to O
the O
south O
of O
us B-PER:Group
is O
unclear O
but O
my B-PER:Individual
understanding O
is O
that O
there O
are O
further O
Iraqi B-GPE:Nation
positions O
in O
that O
direction O
as O
well O

and O
that O
was O
extremely O
fortuitous O
. O

It O
was O
like O
sitting O
in O
a O
poker O
game O

drawing O
four O

Seventy O

two O

No O

I B-PER:Individual
do O

" O
There O
's O
nothing O
so O
exhilarating O
as O

What O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
try O
to O
do O
is O
stay O
calm O

continue O
your B-PER:Indeterminate

The O
worst O
thing O
you B-PER:Indeterminate

either O
as O
a B-PER:Indeterminate
soldier I-PER:Indeterminate

as O
a B-PER:Indeterminate

if O
I B-PER:Individual

You B-PER:Indeterminate

out B-LOC:Land-Region-Natural

Of O

, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate

adrenaline O
high O

but O
racing O
across O
the B-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
desert I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural

you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
that O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
're O
traveling O
toward O
the O
jaws O
of O
what O
could O
be O
a O
major O
military O
battle O
. O

You B-PER:Group
have O
to O
realize O
, O
they B-PER:Group
've O
been O
riding O
along O
, O
bouncing O
along O
in O
these B-VEH:Land
tanks I-VEH:Land
for O
probably O
six O
or O
more O
hours O
now O

And O
if O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
ride O
inside O
that B-VEH:Land
tank I-VEH:Land

it O
is O
like O
riding O
in O
the O
bowels O
of O
a O
dragon O
. O

The O
hardest O
part O
of O
the O
trip O
is O
personal O
discomfort O

We B-PER:Group
can O
not O
tell O
you B-PER:Group
the O
levels O
of O
personal O
discomfort O
we B-PER:Group
've O
experienced O
. O

The O
extraordinary O
sandstorms O
, O
the O
bitter O
cold O
nights O
. O

The O
most O
uncomfortable O
thing O
is O
having O
to O
sleep O
sitting O
up O
in O
a B-VEH:Land
Humvee I-VEH:Land
with O
sandbags O
under O
your B-PER:Indeterminate
feet O

your B-PER:Indeterminate

at O
your B-PER:Indeterminate

That O
's O
excruciatingly O
uncomfortable O
, O
not O
something O
that O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
would O
wish O
on O
anybody B-PER:Indeterminate
but I-PER:Indeterminate
a I-PER:Indeterminate
contortionist I-PER:Indeterminate
. I-PER:Indeterminate

Let O
me B-PER:Individual
give O
you B-PER:Group
an O
example O
of O
what O
the O
dust O
like O
. O

We B-PER:Group
have O
been O
through O
days O
of O
dust O
like O
that O
. O

The B-ORG:Government
U.S. I-ORG:Government
Army I-ORG:Government
's I-ORG:Government
7th I-ORG:Government

has O
just O
taken O
three B-PER:Group
Iraqi I-PER:Group
prisoners I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
war I-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

Actually O
, O
they B-PER:Group
're O
very O
close O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
no O
more O
than O
40 O
yards O
away O
, O
but O
the O
dust O
and O
sand O
are O
blowing O
so O
badly O
you B-PER:Group
're O
getting O
these O
vague O
images O
. O

It O
's O
like O
being O
in O
a O
blizzard O
, O
except O
unfortunately O
, O
the O
sand O
does O
n't O
melt O
as O
the O
snow O
does O
. O

What O
we B-PER:Group
eat O
is O
what O
the B-ORG:Government
Army I-ORG:Government
calls O
MREs O
, O
meals O
ready O
to O
eat O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
must O
say O
, O
they O
're O
pretty O
darn O
good O
. O

And O
of O
course O
, O
everybody B-PER:Group
fights O
for O
the O
best O
ones O
. O

The O
treats O
are O
things O
like O
the O
M& O

and O
the O
breakfast O
toasties O

The B-ORG:Government
Army I-ORG:Government
is O
eating O
much O

much O
better O
than O
the B-PER:Group
grandfathers I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
these I-PER:Group
soldiers I-PER:Group

You B-PER:Group

What O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
suppose O
right O
now O
would O
be O
the O
governor O
on O
the O
forward O

? O

Is O
it O
the B-ORG:Government

or O
is O
it O
the B-FAC:Path
U.S. I-FAC:Path
and I-FAC:Path
coalition I-FAC:Path
supply I-FAC:Path

? I-FAC:Path

Well O
, O
they B-PER:Group
are O
close O
enough O
up O
to O
Baghdad B-GPE:Population-Center
now O
so O
that O
the O
supply B-FAC:Path

issue O
is O
probably O
not O
a O
big O
one O
since O
they B-PER:Group
had O
time O
to O

food O
, O
fuel O

ammunition B-WEA:Projectile

So O
, O
probably O
the O
main O
thing O
is O
combing O
through O
the O
rubble O
that O
the B-ORG:Government
air I-ORG:Government
force I-ORG:Government
has O
left O
of O
these B-PER:Group

make O
sure O
there O
are O
no O

that O

leave O

that O

I B-PER:Individual
would O

there O

a O
pause O

they B-PER:Group
start O

let O
me B-PER:Individual
ask O
you B-PER:Individual
that O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
just O
wanted O
to O
tell O

we B-ORG:Media

This B-LOC:Region-General

We B-ORG:Media

supposedly O

as O
15 O

One B-FAC:Airport

Do O
you B-PER:Individual
suppose O
that B-FAC:Airport
is O
a B-FAC:Airport

right O
now O
? O

Oh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
sure O
it B-FAC:Airport

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
a O
feature O

that O
importance O
would O
always O
be O
something O
you B-PER:Indeterminate

want O

hold O

And O
besides O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
get O
control O
of O
it B-FAC:Airport
you B-PER:Indeterminate
'd O
be O
able O
to O
start O
using O
it B-FAC:Airport
for O
air O
operations O
, O
and O
put O
a B-PER:Group
survey I-PER:Group
team I-PER:Group
in O
there B-FAC:Airport
as O
soon O
as O
it B-FAC:Airport
's O
secured O
, O
and O
then O
start O
using O
it B-FAC:Airport
for O
helicopter B-VEH:Air
operations O
, O
haul O
forward O
some O
big O
bladders O

refuel O

rearm O
them B-VEH:Air

things O
like O
that O

And O
if O
the O
front O
stabilizes O
between O
there B-FAC:Airport

the B-LOC:Region-General
downtown I-LOC:Region-General
Baghdad I-LOC:Region-General
, I-LOC:Region-General
they B-PER:Group
'll O
start O

well O

O'BRIEN B-PER:Individual

, O
as O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
go O
from O
Saddam B-FAC:Airport

you B-PER:Indeterminate
see O
there O
are O
some B-FAC:Path
big I-FAC:Path

there B-GPE:Population-Center

these B-FAC:Path

will O
be O
crucial O
wo O
n't O
it O
? O

LANG B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
these B-FAC:Path
are O
the B-FAC:Path
high I-FAC:Path
- I-FAC:Path
speed I-FAC:Path
approaches I-FAC:Path

the I-FAC:Path

love O

Some B-PER:Group
have O
said O
Chicago B-GPE:Population-Center
is O
a O
good O
analogy O
. O

Tremendous O
amount O
of O
force O
needed O
to O
control O
a B-GPE:Population-Center

that I-GPE:Population-Center
source I-GPE:Population-Center
, I-GPE:Population-Center
or O
am O
a B-PER:Individual
wrong O
? O

Well O
, O
it O
depends O
on O
the O
attitude O
of O
the B-GPE:Population-Center
populous I-GPE:Population-Center
, I-GPE:Population-Center
which O
is O
not O
clear O
yet O

If O
the B-GPE:Population-Center
population I-GPE:Population-Center

in O
fact O
, O
or O
at O

a O
big O

the O

Shia B-PER:Group
half O

the B-GPE:Population-Center
population I-GPE:Population-Center
, I-GPE:Population-Center
if O
they B-PER:Group
want O
to O

, O
then O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
can O
control O
them B-PER:Group
with O
a B-PER:Group
fairly I-PER:Group
small I-PER:Group
force I-PER:Group

If O

, O
a B-PER:Group

you B-PER:Indeterminate

never O
going O

know O
that O
until O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
try O
, O
then O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
're O
going O
to O
need O
a B-PER:Group
much I-PER:Group
larger I-PER:Group
force I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
and O
we B-ORG:Media
might O
end O
up O
waiting O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
for O
reinforcements B-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

Based O
on O
what O
you B-PER:Individual
've O
seen O
so O
far O
, O
what O
is O
your B-PER:Individual
sense O
of O
that O
? O

The B-PER:Group
Shias I-PER:Group
are O
a O
bit O
gun O
shy O
, O
if O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
will O
, O
in O
the B-LOC:Region-General
south I-LOC:Region-General
because O
of O
what O
happened O
in O
1991 O
. O

They B-PER:Group
rose O
up O
, O
did O

get O
American B-GPE:Nation

Do O
you B-PER:Individual

it O
will O
be O
a O
different O
story O
in O

there O
a O

that O

come O
out O

Yes O
, O
there O
is O
, O
but O
these B-PER:Group
folks I-PER:Group
are O
going O
to O
be O
mighty O
cautious O

They B-PER:Group
have O
a O
long O
history O

the B-PER:Group

we B-PER:Group
asked O

he B-PER:Individual
still O
have O
any B-WEA:Shooting

him B-PER:Individual

, O
and O
she B-PER:Individual

just O
, O
she B-PER:Individual
just O
sounded O
real O
good O
. O

Of O

she B-PER:Individual

groggy O
. O

But O

, O
she B-PER:Individual
was O

this O
afternoon O
, O
after O

, O
do O
they B-PER:Group
know O

the O

? O

They B-PER:Group
have O
no O

time O
what O

them O
. O

We B-PER:Group
know O
she B-PER:Individual

because O
they B-PER:Group

arm O
so O
we B-PER:Group
know O
she B-PER:Individual
-- O
her B-PER:Individual
mind O
is O
working O
good O
. O

So O
she B-PER:Individual

Completely O

situation O
in O
which O
we B-ORG:Government
did O
not O
have O
such B-VEH:Land

And O
we B-ORG:Government
also O

not O

We B-ORG:Government
are O
much O
more O

rather O
than O

We B-ORG:Media
want O
to O
show O
you B-PER:Individual
an O
animation O
, O
and O
share O
with O
our B-PER:Group
viewers I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
maybe O
you B-PER:Individual
can O
point O
out O
a O
few O
things O
about O
this O
. O

If O
we B-GPE:Nation
move O
in O
on O
Baghdad B-GPE:Population-Center
, I-GPE:Population-Center
and O
give O
you B-PER:Individual
a O
sense O
of O
the O
kinds O
of O
targets O
that O
might O
be O
encountered O
in O
urban O

What O
we B-ORG:Media
've O
depicted O
here O
is O
something O
here O
which O
shows O
some O

off O

here O
, O
right O
over O
here O
is O
a B-FAC:Building-Grounds
mosque I-FAC:Building-Grounds
. I-FAC:Building-Grounds

We B-ORG:Media
depict O
that O
to O
show O
that O
's O
something O
you B-ORG:Government
obviously O
want O
to O
stay O
clear O
as O
we B-PER:Group
just O
saw O
with O
the O
Ryan B-PER:Individual
Chilcote I-PER:Individual
piece O
from O
Najaf B-GPE:Population-Center
. I-GPE:Population-Center

As O
we B-PER:Group
get O
a O
little O
bit O
closer O
here O
, O
in O
a O
typical O
scenario O
like O
this O
, O
you B-ORG:Government
might O
very O
well O
have O
Republican B-PER:Group
Guard I-PER:Group
snipers I-PER:Group
up O
on O
balconies B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
like O
this B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
, I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
and O
possibly O
up O
on O
the B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
roofs I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
of I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
buildings I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
and O
anti-aircraft B-WEA:Shooting

or O
artillery B-FAC:Building-Grounds
encampments I-FAC:Building-Grounds
like O
that O
. O

What O
we B-PER:Group
have O
presented O
her O
is O
an B-VEH:Land
armored I-VEH:Land
column I-VEH:Land
with O
air B-VEH:Air
support I-VEH:Air
coming O
in O
. O

How O
much O
jeopardy O
is O
a B-VEH:Land
column I-VEH:Land
like I-VEH:Land
this I-VEH:Land
in O
as O
it B-VEH:Land
goes O
through O
these B-LOC:Region-General
concrete I-LOC:Region-General
canyons I-LOC:Region-General
in O
a B-GPE:Population-Center
city I-GPE:Population-Center
? I-GPE:Population-Center

I B-PER:Individual
think O
the O
animation O
is O
good O
because O
it O
does O
show O
that O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
can O
hide O
literally O
anywhere O
in O
a O
city B-GPE:Population-Center
environment O
, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
movement O
through O
an B-LOC:Region-General
urban I-LOC:Region-General
area I-LOC:Region-General
is O
very O
, O
very O
dangerous O
. O

It B-PER:Group
's O
the O
side B-PER:Group
that I-PER:Group
's I-PER:Group
moving I-PER:Group
that B-PER:Group
's O
going O
to O
take O
the O
casualties O
. O

That O
said O
, O
the B-VEH:Land
armored I-VEH:Land
fighting I-VEH:Land
vehicles I-VEH:Land
that B-VEH:Land
you B-PER:Indeterminate
see O
there O
they B-VEH:Land
look O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
as O
if O
they B-VEH:Land
're O
moving O
a O
little O
bit O
faster O
as O
than O
we B-ORG:Government
probably O
will O
. O

We B-ORG:Government
'll O
use O
patience O
and O
finesse O
. O

We B-ORG:Government
will O
take O
the O
time O
to O
locate O
the B-PER:Indeterminate
enemy I-PER:Indeterminate
, I-PER:Indeterminate
surround O
the B-FAC:Path
blocks I-FAC:Path
and O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
buildings I-FAC:Building-Grounds
that I-FAC:Building-Grounds
he I-FAC:Building-Grounds
is I-FAC:Building-Grounds
in I-FAC:Building-Grounds
. I-FAC:Building-Grounds

And O
then O
we B-ORG:Government
'll O
probably O
surge O
fires O
into O
their O
both O
lethal O
and O
nonlethal O
to O
make O
his B-PER:Indeterminate
position O
untenable O
, O
to O
make O
him B-PER:Indeterminate
move O
rather O
than O
us B-ORG:Government
moving O
through O
the O
assault O
zone O
. O

At O
which O
time O
we B-ORG:Government
can O
engage O
them B-PER:Indeterminate
or O
arrest O
them B-PER:Indeterminate
. I-PER:Indeterminate

We B-ORG:Media
'd O
like O
to O
resume O
with O
that O
animation O
if O
we B-ORG:Media
could O
. O

Can O
we B-ORG:Media
get O
back O
to O
the O
animation O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
like O
to O
just O
finish O
this O
out O
. O

Ad O
we B-ORG:Media
move O
it O
along O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
'll O
see O
eventually O
the B-PER:Group
troops I-PER:Group
will O
come O
marching O
in O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
slightly O
off O
target O
here O
because O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
see O
them B-PER:Group
all O
going O
in O
the O
front O
door O
. O

Typically O
, O
when O
they B-PER:Group
'd O
assault O
a B-FAC:Building-Grounds
target I-FAC:Building-Grounds
like I-FAC:Building-Grounds
this I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, I-FAC:Building-Grounds
they B-PER:Group
'd O
do O
what O
? O

Well O
, O
typically O
, O
if O
they B-PER:Group
do O
go O
in O
, O
which O
is O
generally O
the O
option O
of O
last O
resort O
, O
but O
if O
we B-ORG:Government
do O
have O
to O
go O
in O
, O
often O
we B-ORG:Government
'll O
try O
to O
go O
in O
from O
the B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
top I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
of I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
the I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
building I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
down O
. O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O
is O
because O
we B-ORG:Government
use O
grenades B-WEA:Exploding
a O
lot O
in O
clearing O
buildings B-FAC:Building-Grounds
, I-FAC:Building-Grounds
and O
grenades B-WEA:Exploding
ten O
to O
offend O
downhill O
rather O
than O
uphill O
. O

So O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
always O
want O
them B-WEA:Exploding
going O
down O
staircases B-FAC:Path
rather O
than O
having O
to O
try O
to O
throw O
them B-WEA:Exploding
up O
the B-FAC:Path
staircase I-FAC:Path

And O

is O
one O
of O
many O
deployments O
he B-PER:Individual

been O
on O

but O
this O
one O
is O
probably O
the O
most O
crucial O
. O

Her B-PER:Group
second I-PER:Group
- I-PER:Group

were O
very O
interested O
in O
sending O
some O
letters O
out O
to O
the B-PER:Group
troops I-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

So O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
knew O

, O
at O
one O
point O
or O
another O
, O
my B-PER:Group
children I-PER:Group
needed O
to O
write O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
thought O
that O

be O
a O
real O
uplifting O
experience O
for O
the B-PER:Group
troops I-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

And O
she B-PER:Individual
says O
: O
" O

" O
We B-PER:Group
would O
have O
to O
say O

very I-PER:Individual
brave I-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
. I-PER:Individual

When O

, O
your B-PER:Individual
heart O
will O
be O
in O
our B-PER:Group
souls O
. O
" O

For O
these B-PER:Group
kids I-PER:Group
to O
takes O
time O
to O
read O
letters O
to O
us B-PER:Group
and O
stuff O
like O
that O
in O
their B-PER:Group
class O
, O
what O
more O
can O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
ask O
? O

There O
will O
be O
more O

Elementary I-PER:Group
second I-PER:Group
- I-PER:Group

are O
working O
on O
the O
next O

You B-PER:Individual
might O
want O
to O
mention O
that O
in O
your B-PER:Individual
letter O
as O
well O
. O

This O
time O
, O
they B-PER:Group
hope O
the B-PER:Group
sailors I-PER:Group
will O
write O
back O
with O
answers O
to O
their B-PER:Group
questions O
. O

So O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
want O
to O
know O
how O
fast O
the O

there O
are O
swimming O
? O

I B-PER:Individual
would O
write O
that O
down O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
would O
say O
: O
" O

some O

? O

They B-PER:Group
will O
be O
happy O
to O
answer O

It O
is O
a O
huge O
sigh O
of O
relief O
, O
because O
it O
could O
have O
been O
much O
worse O
and O
Baghdad B-GPE:Population-Center
could O
have O
been O
a B-GPE:Population-Center
war I-GPE:Population-Center

more I-GPE:Population-Center

And O
, O
obviously O
, O
there O
are O
four B-PER:Group
million I-PER:Group

who I-PER:Group
could I-PER:Group
have I-PER:Group
suffered I-PER:Group
more I-PER:Group

So O
, O
there O
is O
a O
sigh O
of O
relief O
that O
it O
is O
not O
worse O
. O

But O
, O
obviously O
, O
there O
is O
a O
great O
, O
great O
concern O
about O
the O
scenes O
that O
you B-ORG:Media
've O
been O
showing O
on O

. O

Are O
you B-PER:Individual
talking O

, O
if O
you B-PER:Individual

, O
how O
concerned O
are O
they B-PER:Group
about O
the O
lawlessness O
? O

KUBBA B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
not O
in O
the O
recent O
three O
or O
four O
days O
. O

There O
are O
no O
phone O
lines O
to O
Baghdad B-GPE:Population-Center

In O
other B-LOC:Region-General
parts I-LOC:Region-General
of I-LOC:Region-General
Iraq I-LOC:Region-General
, I-LOC:Region-General
I B-PER:Individual
received O
with O
great O
sadness O
the O
killing O
of O
one B-PER:Individual
close I-PER:Individual
colleague I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
Saeed B-PER:Individual
Abu I-PER:Individual
Naji I-PER:Individual

( O

He B-PER:Individual
was O
not O
killed O
by O
former B-PER:Group
members I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group

Party I-PER:Group
or O
the B-PER:Group
security I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
army I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
but O
by O
just O
a B-ORG:Non-Governmental
local I-ORG:Non-Governmental
organized I-ORG:Non-Governmental
group I-ORG:Non-Governmental
. I-ORG:Non-Governmental

So O
those O
signs O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
are O
worrying O
. O

People B-PER:Group
are O
sensing O
and O
feeling O
the O
lack O
of O
authority O
or O
the O
power O
vacuum O
and O
are O
testing O
it O
. O

And O
the O
more O
they B-PER:Group
test O
, O
the O
more O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
they B-PER:Group
are O
claiming O
. O

How O
difficult O
will O
it O
be O
to O
sort O
out O
who B-PER:Indeterminate
will O
next O
hold O
power O
in O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
after O
this O
transition O
period O
, O
however O
long O
it O
is O
, O
where O
the B-GPE:Nation
U.S. I-GPE:Nation
is O
in O
charge O
? O

Well O
, O
one B-PER:Individual
needs O
to O
break O
down O
this O
process O
into O
various O
elements O
. O

Today O
, O
there O
should O
be O
an B-ORG:Government
authority I-ORG:Government
. I-ORG:Government

And O
it O
's O
very O
likely O
that O
the B-GPE:Nation
U.S. I-GPE:Nation
and O
the B-PER:Group
British I-PER:Group
forces I-PER:Group
are O
the O
authority O
on O
land O
. O

And O
there O
ought O
to O
be O
administration O
. O

And O
this O
ought O
to O
be O
primarily O
by O
Iraqis B-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

But O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
government B-ORG:Government
, I-ORG:Government
I B-PER:Individual
think O
we B-GPE:Nation
really O
need O
to O
map O
out O
step O
by O
step O
how O
to O
move O
from O
this O
power O
vacuum O
to O
the O
day O
we B-GPE:Nation
have O
elections O
. O

We B-GPE:Nation
need O
to O
involve O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
U.N I-ORG:Non-Governmental
. I-ORG:Non-Governmental
We B-GPE:Nation
need O
to O
involve O
all B-PER:Group
Iraqi I-PER:Group
forces I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
country I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
outside O
the B-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation
. I-GPE:Nation

But O
we B-GPE:Nation
need O
to O
do O
it O
quickly O
, O
because O
every O
day O
passes O
by O
with O
this O
vacuum O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
spell O
trouble O
. O

Well O
, O
we B-ORG:Media
know O
, O
Mr. B-PER:Individual
Kubba I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
there O
are O
several B-ORG:Non-Governmental
Iraqi I-ORG:Non-Governmental
exiles I-ORG:Non-Governmental
groups I-ORG:Non-Governmental
competing O
for O
influence O
. O

Is O
one B-ORG:Non-Governmental
of I-ORG:Non-Governmental
them I-ORG:Non-Governmental
going O
to O
have O
an O
advantage O
? O

And O
, O
particularly O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
have O
in O
mind O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
Iraqi I-ORG:Non-Governmental
National I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Congress I-ORG:Non-Governmental
that O
Mr. B-PER:Individual
Chalabi I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
was I-PER:Individual
assisted I-PER:Individual
by I-PER:Individual
U.S. I-PER:Individual
forces I-PER:Individual
in I-PER:Individual
getting I-PER:Individual
back I-PER:Individual
into I-PER:Individual
Iraq I-PER:Individual
? I-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
one O
thing O
to O
gain O
fame O
and O
access O
to O
Washington B-GPE:Population-Center
. I-GPE:Population-Center

It O
's O
totally O
another O
to O
gain O
legitimacy O
and O
functioning O
grounds O
inside O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
. I-GPE:Nation

And O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
plans O
must O
not O
be O
drawn O
in O
thin O
air O
out O
in O
Washington B-GPE:Population-Center
. I-GPE:Population-Center

It O
must O
really O
be O
drawn O
on O
the B-LOC:Region-General
ground I-LOC:Region-General
inside I-LOC:Region-General
Iraq I-LOC:Region-General
. I-LOC:Region-General

And O
there O
are O
22 B-PER:Group
million I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
there B-GPE:Nation
. I-GPE:Nation

And O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
all O
plans O
must O
be O
anchored O
there B-GPE:Nation
in I-GPE:Nation
Iraq I-GPE:Nation
in O
its B-GPE:Nation
reality O
. O

So O
does O
one B-ORG:Non-Governmental
group I-ORG:Non-Governmental
have O
an O
advantage O
over O
another B-ORG:Non-Governmental
now O
? O

There O
are O
different B-ORG:Non-Governmental
groups I-ORG:Non-Governmental
who I-ORG:Non-Governmental
have I-ORG:Non-Governmental
advantage I-ORG:Non-Governmental
over I-ORG:Non-Governmental
others I-ORG:Non-Governmental
in I-ORG:Non-Governmental
different I-ORG:Non-Governmental
parts I-ORG:Non-Governmental
of I-ORG:Non-Governmental
the I-ORG:Non-Governmental
country I-ORG:Non-Governmental
. I-ORG:Non-Governmental

Unfortunately O
, O
we B-GPE:Nation
do O
not O
have O
a B-ORG:Non-Governmental
national I-ORG:Non-Governmental
group I-ORG:Non-Governmental
that I-ORG:Non-Governmental
can I-ORG:Non-Governmental
appeal I-ORG:Non-Governmental
to I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Iraqis I-ORG:Non-Governmental
as I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Iraqis I-ORG:Non-Governmental
within I-ORG:Non-Governmental
a I-ORG:Non-Governmental
credible I-ORG:Non-Governmental
voice.This I-ORG:Non-Governmental
needs O
to O
be O
constructed O
, O
maybe O
through O
a O
conference O
to O
be O
held O
in O
Baghdad B-GPE:Population-Center
, I-GPE:Population-Center
where B-GPE:Population-Center
representatives B-PER:Group
from I-PER:Group

all I-PER:Group

need O
to O
participate O
, O
as O
well O
as O
political B-ORG:Non-Governmental
groups I-ORG:Non-Governmental
. I-ORG:Non-Governmental

But O
we B-GPE:Nation
do O
not O
have O
a B-ORG:Non-Governmental

, I-ORG:Non-Governmental

I B-PER:Individual

this O
morning O
on O
the O

a O
bit O
, O
and O
it O

not O

I B-PER:Individual

you B-PER:Individual
need O
to O
let O
the O
dust O
settle O
on O
that O
. O

He B-PER:Individual

, O
in O
my B-PER:Individual
judgment O
, O
had O
a O
visit O

was O
worth O

, O
and O
the B-PER:Individual
president I-PER:Individual
asked O
him B-PER:Individual
to O
do O
it O
, O
and O
it O
was O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
. O

We B-PER:Group

see O
what O

comes O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O

words O
are O
one O
thing O
, O
actions O
are O
another O
. O

But O
right O
now O
you B-PER:Individual
're O
open O
- O
minded O
as O
far O
as O
Syria B-GPE:Nation
on O
whether O
they B-GPE:Nation
will O
crack O
down O
on O
terrorism O
, O
take O
some O
of O
the O
other O
steps O
that O
you B-PER:Individual
want O
them B-GPE:Nation
to O
take O
? O

I B-PER:Individual
know O
what O
they B-GPE:Nation
've O
been O
doing O
, O
and O
it O
's O
been O
unhelpful O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
know O
that O
Secretary B-PER:Individual
Powell I-PER:Individual
was O
just O
there B-GPE:Nation
and O
advised O
them B-GPE:Nation
that O
it O
was O
unhelpful O
, O
and O
gave O
them B-GPE:Nation
some O
pointers O
and O
some O
suggestions O
for O
the O
future O
. O

In O
my B-PER:Individual
view O
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
were O
making O
some O
unwise O
decisions O
previously O
. O

What O
they B-GPE:Nation
'll O
do O
after O
this O
visit O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O

The B-PER:Individual

appropriate O
, O
and O
what O
Colin B-PER:Individual
and O
I B-PER:Individual
have O
been O
concerned O
about O
, O
both B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
us I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
is O
that O
it O
's O
taking O
so O
long O
. O

There O
are O
a B-GPE:Nation
number I-GPE:Nation
of I-GPE:Nation
countries I-GPE:Nation
, I-GPE:Nation
and O
the B-ORG:Government
Department I-ORG:Government
of I-ORG:Government
State I-ORG:Government
has O
the O
responsibility O
of O
dealing O
with O
those B-GPE:Nation
countries I-GPE:Nation
, I-GPE:Nation
that B-GPE:Nation
have O
foreign B-PER:Group
nationals I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
Gitmo I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
Guantanamo I-PER:Group

, I-PER:Group
Cuba I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
being I-PER:Group
detained I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
and O
those B-GPE:Nation
countries I-GPE:Nation
, I-GPE:Nation
understandably O
, O
would O
like O
to O
know O
when O
they B-GPE:Nation
could O
have O
those B-PER:Group
people.So I-PER:Group
the O
inter-agency B-ORG:Government
process O
takes O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
time O
. O

Colin B-PER:Individual
and O
I B-PER:Individual
are O
trying O
to O
speed O
up O
that O
process O
, O
and O
that O
's O
what O
that O
's O
all O
about O
. O

Let O
me B-PER:Individual
just O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
nuggets O
to O
sort O
of O
wrap O
up O
before O
I B-PER:Individual
let O
you B-PER:Individual
go O
. O

Victory O
parades O
for O
the B-PER:Group
troops I-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

I B-PER:Individual
remember O
covering O
General B-PER:Individual
Schwarzkopf I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
the O
parades O
in O
Washington B-GPE:Population-Center
and O
New B-GPE:Population-Center
York I-GPE:Population-Center
after O
the O
first O
Gulf B-LOC:Water-Body
War O
. O

Do O
you B-PER:Individual
want O
the B-PER:Group
troops I-PER:Group
to O
be O
honored O
in O
that O
way O
when O
they B-PER:Group
come O
back O
, O
to O
have O
parades O
in O
New B-GPE:Population-Center

, I-GPE:Population-Center
Washington B-GPE:Population-Center
, I-GPE:Population-Center
elsewhere B-GPE:Population-Center
? I-GPE:Population-Center

There O
's O
no O
question O
but O
that O
the B-PER:Group
troops I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
the B-PER:Group
young I-PER:Group
men I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
women I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
did O
such O
a O
superb O
job O
that O
there O
has O
to O
be O
a O
way O
to O
honor O
them B-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
and O
there O
will O
be O
. O

And O
General B-PER:Individual
Franks I-PER:Individual
and O
his B-PER:Group
team I-PER:Group
have O
done O
just O
a O
superb O
job O
for O
our B-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation
and O
for O
the B-LOC:Celestial
world I-LOC:Celestial
, I-LOC:Celestial
and O
indeed O
for O
the B-GPE:Nation
Iraqi I-GPE:Nation
people I-GPE:Nation
, I-GPE:Nation
who I-GPE:Nation
have I-GPE:Nation
been I-GPE:Nation
liberated I-GPE:Nation
. I-GPE:Nation

What O
's O
the O
best O
way O
to O
do O
that O
? O

In O
the O
case O
of O
1991 O
, O
the O
task O
was O
to O
go O
in O
and O
get O
them B-PER:Group
out O
of O
Kuwait B-GPE:Nation
, I-GPE:Nation
and O
they B-PER:Group
did O
it O
, O
and O
they B-PER:Group
were O
properly O
greeted O
coming O
back O
to O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
. I-GPE:Nation

In O
this O
instance O
, O
it O
was O
a O
very O
different O
task O
. O

It O
was O
to O
remove O
that B-ORG:Government
regime I-ORG:Government
, I-ORG:Government
and O
it O
's O
part O
of O
a O
global O
war O
on O
terrorism O
that O
is O
not O
over O
. O

We B-GPE:Nation
still O
have O
to O
face O
the O
problem O
of O
a B-ORG:Non-Governmental
number I-ORG:Non-Governmental
of I-ORG:Non-Governmental
global I-ORG:Non-Governmental
terrorist I-ORG:Non-Governmental
networks I-ORG:Non-Governmental
and O
terrorist B-GPE:Nation
states I-GPE:Nation
that I-GPE:Nation
exist I-GPE:Nation
, I-GPE:Nation
that I-GPE:Nation
work I-GPE:Nation
with I-GPE:Nation
those I-GPE:Nation
global I-GPE:Nation
networks I-GPE:Nation
. I-GPE:Nation

And O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
we B-GPE:Nation
will O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
find O
a O
way O
to O
honor O
the O
courage O
and O
dedication O
and O
talent O
of O
these B-PER:Group
young I-PER:Group
men I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
women I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
and O
we B-GPE:Nation
'll O
do O
it O
well O
. O

Whether O
it O
will O
be O
modeled O
off O
the O
1991 O
thing O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
kind O
of O
doubt O
it O
, O
because O
it O
's O
such O
a O
different O
circumstance O
. O

Certainly O
, O
our B-GPE:Nation
war O
plan O
was O
not O
modeled O
off O
of O
1991 O
. O

One O
final O
question O
on O
North B-GPE:Nation
Korea I-GPE:Nation
. I-GPE:Nation

If O
the B-GPE:Nation
North I-GPE:Nation
Koreans I-GPE:Nation
pursue O
their B-GPE:Nation
nuclear B-WEA:Nuclear
weapons I-WEA:Nuclear
ambitions O

something O

I B-PER:Individual

not O
one B-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
speculates I-PER:Individual
about I-PER:Individual
things I-PER:Individual
like I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
. I-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual
know O
that O
back O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
in O
the B-ORG:Government
Clinton I-ORG:Government

, I-ORG:Government
Secretary B-PER:Individual

and O
we B-PER:Group
had O
a O
discussion O
, O
and O
they B-ORG:Government
clearly O
had O
teed O
up O
a O

they B-ORG:Government

all O

CHRISTOPHER I-PER:Individual
DODD I-PER:Individual
( I-PER:Individual

, I-PER:Individual
CONNECTICUT I-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual
have O
no O
evidence O
to O
the O
contrary O
. O

And O
certainly O
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
have O
used O
them B-WEA:Underspecified
in O
the O
past O
. O

There O
's O
no O
doubt O
about O
that O
at O
all O
, O
both O
in O
Iran B-GPE:Nation
and O
against O
the B-PER:Group
Kurdish I-PER:Group
population I-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

So O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
they B-GPE:Nation
find O
them B-WEA:Underspecified
in O
the O
exact O
form O
that O
many B-PER:Group
would O
assume O
they B-WEA:Underspecified
would O
be O
the O
case O
-- O
possibly O
some B-WEA:Underspecified
got O
out O
of O
the B-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation
. I-GPE:Nation

It O
would O
n't O
surprise O
me B-PER:Individual
to O
hear O
that O
. O

But O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
going O
to O
work O
on O
the O
assumption O
, O
based O
on O
the O
intelligence O
that O
has O
been O
gathered O
, O
that O
the B-WEA:Underspecified
weapons I-WEA:Underspecified
of I-WEA:Underspecified
mass I-WEA:Underspecified
destruction I-WEA:Underspecified
existed O
. O

Well O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
've O
used O
it B-WEA:Underspecified
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
the O
point O
that O
Senator B-PER:Individual
Lugar I-PER:Individual
just O
made O
-- O
certainly O
having O
the O
intellectual O
capacity O
to O
do O
this O
was O
proven O
already O
by O
the O
fact O
they B-GPE:Nation
've O
used O
them B-WEA:Underspecified
in O
the O
past O
. O

So O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
would O
n't O
dwell O
on O
that O
point O
specifically O
, O
because O
Saddam B-PER:Individual
Hussein I-PER:Individual
clearly O
was O
a B-PER:Individual
producer I-PER:Individual
and I-PER:Individual
a I-PER:Individual
user I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
biological I-PER:Individual
and I-PER:Individual
chemical I-PER:Individual
weapons I-PER:Individual
. I-PER:Individual

He B-PER:Individual
clearly O
was O
on O
the O
track O
to O
acquire O
a O
nuclear O
capacity O
, O
and O
the B-LOC:Celestial
world I-LOC:Celestial
is O
a B-LOC:Celestial
safer I-LOC:Celestial

because O

no O
so O

No O
, O
we B-GPE:Nation
have O
full O
credibility O
in O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation

We B-GPE:Nation
've O
prosecuted O
with O

alliance I-GPE:Nation
a O
successful O
liberation O
of O
the B-GPE:Nation
Iraqi I-GPE:Nation
people I-GPE:Nation
, I-GPE:Nation
and O
we B-GPE:Nation
have O
clearly O
caused O
Saddam B-PER:Individual
to O
destroy O
weapons B-WEA:Underspecified
of I-WEA:Underspecified
mass I-WEA:Underspecified
destruction I-WEA:Underspecified
, I-WEA:Underspecified
or O
at O
least O
to O
suppress O
evidence O
of O
them B-WEA:Underspecified

That O
is O
a O
victory O
of O
sorts.This O
is O
a O
facet O
that O
's O
important O

It O
's O
important O
in O
the O
war O
against O

that O
we B-GPE:Nation
rout O
out O

is O
there B-GPE:Nation
and O
, O
likewise O
, O
the B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
involved I-PER:Group

because O
they B-PER:Group
might O
help O

BLITZER B-PER:Individual
Senator B-PER:Individual
Dodd I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
how O
important O
is O
it O
for O
the B-GPE:Nation
U.S. I-GPE:Nation
to O
conclusively O
learn O
what O
happened O
to O
Saddam B-PER:Individual
Hussein I-PER:Individual
? I-PER:Individual

But O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
as O
important O
as O
finding O
Osama B-PER:Individual
bin I-PER:Individual
Laden I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
for O
the O
simple O
reason O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
Saddam B-PER:Individual
Hussein I-PER:Individual
today O
poses O
any O
threat O
, O
wherever O
he B-PER:Individual
is O
. O

If O
he B-PER:Individual
is O
alive O
, O
obviously O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
does O
n't O
pose O
the O
kind O
of O
threat O
that O
an B-PER:Individual
Osama I-PER:Individual
bin I-PER:Individual
Laden I-PER:Individual
does O
with O
his B-ORG:Non-Governmental
cellular I-ORG:Non-Governmental
network I-ORG:Non-Governmental
around I-ORG:Non-Governmental
the I-ORG:Non-Governmental
world I-ORG:Non-Governmental
to O
reactivate O
al B-ORG:Non-Governmental

and O
international O
terrorism O
. O

So O
, O
it O
would O
certainly O
be O
good O
to O
know O
where O
he B-PER:Individual
is O
. O

It O
would O
be O
, O
certainly O
, O
to O
know O
, O
to O
apprehend O
him B-PER:Individual

to O
bring O
him B-PER:Individual
before O
a B-ORG:Government
court I-ORG:Government
of I-ORG:Government
justice I-ORG:Government
. I-ORG:Government

But O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
absolutely O
critical O
for O
the O
ultimate O
success O
of O

told O
you B-PER:Individual
in O
the O
last O
interview O
, O
that O
we B-GPE:Nation
will O
have O
troops B-PER:Group
there B-GPE:Nation
as O
long O
as O
necessary O
, O
but O
no O
longer O
than O
necessary O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
's O
a O
pretty O
good O
way O
to O
state O
it O
. O

My B-PER:Individual
own O
view O
is O
that O
the O
security O
of O
the B-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation
clearly O
is O
our B-GPE:Nation
responsibility O
presently O
. O

We B-GPE:Nation
are O
trying O
to O
pass O
that O
on O
to O
others B-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

Likewise O
, O
the B-ORG:Government
other I-ORG:Government
government I-ORG:Government
's O
procedures O
, O
the O
fledgling O
beginnings O
on O
democracy O
, O
and O
all O
the O
rest O
. O

But O
that O
's O
going O
to O
require O
an O
undergirding O
. O

Now O
, O
in O
due O
course O
, O
as O
everybody B-PER:Group
points O
out O
, O
we B-GPE:Nation
may O
get O
help O
from O
other B-GPE:Nation
countries I-GPE:Nation
. I-GPE:Nation

We B-GPE:Nation
may O
bring O
in O
NATO B-GPE:Nation
allies I-GPE:Nation
or O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
United I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Nations I-ORG:Non-Governmental
or O
other B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
Arab I-PER:Group
world I-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

But O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
this O
is O
our B-GPE:Nation
responsibility O
. O

And O
we B-GPE:Nation
ought O
not O
to O
be O
having O
large O
debates O
about O
how O
rapidly O
we B-GPE:Nation
move O
out O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
upset O
, O
in O
a O
way O
, O
to O
hear O
reports O
that O
by O
the O
fall O
, O
three B-ORG:Government
divisions I-ORG:Government
out I-ORG:Government
of I-ORG:Government
five I-ORG:Government
would O
be O
gone O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
Secretary B-PER:Individual
Rumsfeld I-PER:Individual
disabused O
us B-PER:Group
of O
that O
today O
. O

And O
what O
about O
you B-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
Senator B-PER:Individual
Dodd I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
not O
only O
the O
length O
of O
time O
, O
but O
the O
cost O
to O
U.S. B-PER:Group
taxpayers I-PER:Group
? I-PER:Group

Have O
you B-PER:Individual
been O
given O
any O
ballpark O
estimate O
what O
this O
is O
going O
to O
cost O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
? I-GPE:Nation

Well O
, O
what O
we B-PER:Group
've O
heard O
the O
numbers O
of O
reconstruction O
running O
around O
$ O
100 B-Numeric:Money
billion I-Numeric:Money
. I-Numeric:Money

We B-GPE:Nation
put O
$ O
2.5 B-Numeric:Money
billion I-Numeric:Money
in O
, O
in O
the O
last O
supplemental O
appropriations O
bill O
. O

So O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
costly O
. O

These O
RFPs O
, O
these O
seeking O
bids O
on O
various O
contracts O
are O
rather O
costly O
, O
and O
so O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
expensive O
. O

And O
clearly O
the O
responsibility O
is O
going O
to O
fall O
principally O
on O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
. I-GPE:Nation

Now O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
would O
hope O
that O
sooner O
rather O
than O
later O
we B-PER:Group
could O
see O
a B-ORG:Government
civilian I-ORG:Government
government I-ORG:Government
emerge O
in O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
, I-GPE:Nation
a B-ORG:Government
democratically I-ORG:Government
elected I-ORG:Government
one I-ORG:Government
, I-ORG:Government
that O
there O
'd O
be O
more O
cooperation O
from O
the O
international O
community O
, O
on O
both O
the O
peacekeeping O
side O
as O
well O
as O
the O
political O
restructuring O
that O
's O
necessary O
in O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
. I-GPE:Nation

And O
to O
the O
extent O
we B-GPE:Nation
can O
move O
that O
along O
more O
quickly O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
we B-GPE:Nation
're O
all O
going O
to O
be O
better O
off O
. O

Being O
the B-GPE:Nation
sole I-GPE:Nation

or I-GPE:Nation
almost I-GPE:Nation
the I-GPE:Nation
sole I-GPE:Nation
power I-GPE:Nation
there I-GPE:Nation
, I-GPE:Nation
both O
in O
terms O
of O
reconstruction O
and O
politically O

exposes O

not O
it O

: O
and O
yet O
another O
reason O
why O
that O
bone O
could O
be O
a O
key O

, O
there O
are O
reports O
that O
have O

that O
in O

the B-PER:Group

on I-PER:Individual
what I-PER:Individual
's I-PER:Individual
called I-PER:Individual
alufating I-PER:Individual

basically O
this B-PER:Individual

look O

this O

i B-PER:Individual
'm O
sure O
that O
it O

the O

the B-PER:Group

will O
go O
24 O

there O

a O

depending O
on O
the O

it O

very O
possible O
that O

very O
common O
in O

that O
someone B-PER:Individual

not O
survive O
a O
certain O
amount O

also O
the O
reason O
for O
the O

good O
to O

you B-PER:Individual
, O
jeff B-PER:Individual

it O
was O
only O
about O
30 O
years O
ago O
when O
we B-PER:Group
went O
to O
the B-LOC:Celestial
moon I-LOC:Celestial
. O

so O
what O
's O
the O
difficulty O
in O
being O
able O
to O
go O
to O
mars B-LOC:Celestial
? O

it O
's O
unimaginably O
difficult O
and O
different O
. O

mars B-LOC:Celestial
is O
at O
most O
times O
100 O
million O
miles O
away O
from O
us B-LOC:Celestial
. O

then O
if O
we B-PER:Group
stay O
there B-LOC:Celestial
for O
about O
a O
year O
or O
two O
, O
the O
whole O
trip O
could O
last O
about O
three O
years O
. O

we B-PER:Group
're O
talking O
about O
conditions O
where O
there O
's O
radiation O
in O
space B-LOC:Celestial
cosmic O
radiation O
that O
could O
cause O
cancer O

the O
communications O
conditions O
once O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
're O
on O
mars B-LOC:Celestial
, O
just O
to O
talk O
to O
people B-PER:Group
on I-PER:Group
earth I-PER:Group
, O
there O
's O
a O
20 O
minute O

so O
the O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
the O
issues O
are O
so O
much O
larger O
than O
going O
to O
the B-LOC:Celestial
moon I-LOC:Celestial
. O

and O
for O
now O
, O
it O
's O
250 O
days O
, O
which O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
maximum O
for O
astronauts B-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
space I-PER:Group
anyway O
. O

but O
as O
you B-PER:Individual
say O
, O
it O
's O
a O
much O
further O
travel O
. O

but O
let O
's B-PER:Group
talk O
about O
some O
of O
the O
hurdles O
that O
hamper O
humans B-PER:Group
to O
be O
able O
to O
survive O
there B-LOC:Celestial
. O

the O
dust O
, O
for O
one O
thing O
. O

let O
's B-PER:Group
talk O
about O
the B-VEH:Air
right I-VEH:Air
kind I-VEH:Air
of I-VEH:Air
spacecraft I-VEH:Air
that I-VEH:Air
would I-VEH:Air
be I-VEH:Air
able I-VEH:Air
to I-VEH:Air
allow I-VEH:Air
humans I-VEH:Air
to I-VEH:Air
actually I-VEH:Air
get I-VEH:Air
that I-VEH:Air
far I-VEH:Air
and I-VEH:Air
to I-VEH:Air
survive I-VEH:Air
. O

well O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
the B-VEH:Air
spacecraft I-VEH:Air
would O
not O
be O
launched O
from O
earth B-LOC:Celestial
. O

you B-PER:Indeterminate
'd O
have O
to O
launch O
is B-VEH:Air
from O
in O
space B-LOC:Celestial
already O
, O
which O
means O
we B-PER:Group
would O
have O
to O
build O
it B-VEH:Air
in O
space B-LOC:Celestial
. O

so O
that O
means O
we B-PER:Group
need O
a B-VEH:Air
good I-VEH:Air
shuttle I-VEH:Air
that I-VEH:Air
's I-VEH:Air
going I-VEH:Air
to I-VEH:Air
take I-VEH:Air
us I-VEH:Air
back I-VEH:Air
and I-VEH:Air
forth I-VEH:Air
to I-VEH:Air
build I-VEH:Air
the I-VEH:Air
spacecraft I-VEH:Air
. O

then O
we B-PER:Group
have O
to O
come O
up O
with O
the O
fuel O
that O
will O
take O
it B-VEH:Air
out O
of O
the B-LOC:Celestial
earth I-LOC:Celestial
's O
orbit O
all O
the O
way O
to O
mars B-LOC:Celestial
. O

that O
's O
probably O
going O
to O
be O
nuclear O
propulsion O
at O
this O
point O
again O
something O
we B-PER:Group
have O
n't O
really O
developed O
yet O
, O
because O
we B-PER:Group
could O
n't O
carry O
that O
much O
fuel O
, O
obviously O
. O

liquid O
oxygen O
would O
be O
way O
too O
heavy O
to O
carry O
all O
the O
way O
to O
mars B-LOC:Celestial
. O

the O
bigger O
issue O
is O
once O
we B-PER:Group
get O
there B-LOC:Celestial
, O
we B-PER:Group
ca O
n't O
carry O
oxygen O
or O
water O
or O
food O
to O
stay O
there B-LOC:Celestial
three O
years O
, O
so O
we B-PER:Group
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
do O
all O
of O
that O
on O
the B-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
surface I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
of I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
the I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
planet I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
. O

so O
we B-PER:Group
ca O
n't O
breathe O
there B-LOC:Celestial
. O

so O
we B-PER:Group
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
come O
up O
with O
some O
conversion O
technique O
to O
create O
water O
, O
to O
create O
oxygen O
and O
then O
some O
way O
of O
growing O
food O
on O
the B-LOC:Celestial
planet I-LOC:Celestial
itself B-LOC:Celestial
. O

all O
of O
this O
is O
in O
the O
works O
now O
, O
but O
i B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
take O
quite O
a O
few O
years O
to O
develop O
it O
. O

you B-PER:Individual
talk O
about O
the O
cosmic O
radiation O
. O

then O
of O
course O
there O
is O
the O
zero O
g O
bone O
loss O
, O
almost O
like O
the O
eroding O
of O
bone O
to O
humans B-PER:Group
that O
would O
be O
at O
risk O
as O
well O
. O

there O
could O
be O
as O
much O
as O
50 B-Numeric:Percent
% I-Numeric:Percent
bone O
loss O
in O
astronauts B-PER:Group
in O
mars B-LOC:Celestial
. O

during O
the O
time O
in O
mars B-LOC:Celestial
. O

because O
when O
the B-PER:Individual
body I-PER:Individual
has O
-- O
when O
there O
is O
no O
dpravity O
as O
there O
is O
on O
mars B-LOC:Celestial
, O
the B-PER:Individual
body I-PER:Individual
does O
n't O
pick O
up O
the O
calcium O
in O
the O
bones O
, O
so O
it B-PER:Individual
does O
n't O
keep O
getting O
the O
bones O
stronger O
and O
stronger O
. O

so O
they B-PER:Group
will O
just O
lose O
it O
. O

they B-PER:Group
will O
be O
almost O
like O
old B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
even O
at O
the O
age O
of O
40 O
. O

thank O
you B-PER:Individual
for O
joining O
us B-PER:Group
. O

looks O
like O
it O
will O
be O
some O
time O
before O
we B-PER:Group
make O
our B-PER:Group
way O
to O
mars B-LOC:Celestial
. O

but O
before O
we B-PER:Group
go O
, O
a O
look O
at O
what O
's O
coming O
up O

a O

Hi O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
Suzanne B-PER:Individual
from O
Philadelphia B-GPE:Population-Center

Sara B-PER:Individual
Hi O
, O
this B-PER:Individual
is O
Sara B-PER:Individual

So O
who B-PER:Group
do O
you B-PER:Individual

Sara B-PER:Individual
uh O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
was O
going O
to O
say O
, O
that O
's O
quite O
the O
topic. O

I B-PER:Individual
have O
n't O
thought O
about O
it O
much O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
know O
my B-PER:Individual
husband I-PER:Individual
said O
he B-PER:Individual
thinks O
-- O
that O
uh O
-- O
Colin B-PER:Individual
Powell I-PER:Individual
should O
-- O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
he B-PER:Individual
will O
. O

Suzanne B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
he B-PER:Individual
think O
will O
either O
, O
because O
he B-PER:Individual
turned O
it O
down O
in O
two O
thousand O
and O
four O
. O

Suzanne B-PER:Individual
Sorry O
, O
two O
thousand O
and O
-- O
two O
thousand O
. O

Two O
thousand O
, O
yeah O
, O
the O
one O
before O
that O
. O

Sara B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
. O
uh O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
very O
fond O
of O
Hillary B-PER:Individual
Clinton I-PER:Individual
, O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
go O
for O
her B-PER:Individual
, O
but O
-- O
but O
uh O
what O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
? O

Suzanne B-PER:Individual
um O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
am O
reluctant O
to O
see O
another B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
brother I-PER:Individual
on O
the O
ticket O
for O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
Republicans I-ORG:Non-Governmental

Suzanne B-PER:Individual
but O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
putting O
Jeb B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
would O
make O
h O
- O
-- O
the O
Republican B-ORG:Non-Governmental
ticket O
easier O
to O
defeat O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
really O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
Hillary B-PER:Individual
Clinton I-PER:Individual
-- O
would O
be O
-- O
a O
good O
choice O
for O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
Democrats I-ORG:Non-Governmental
. O

Suzanne B-PER:Individual
um O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
Barak B-PER:Individual
Obama I-PER:Individual
would O
be O
a O
very O
good O
choice O
for O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
Democrats I-ORG:Non-Governmental
. O

Just O
because O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
really O
young O
, O
and O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
going O
to O
be O
starting O
off O
his B-PER:Individual
career O
. O

Suzanne B-PER:Individual
um O
I B-PER:Individual
would O
almost O
like O
to O
see O
John B-PER:Individual
Edwards I-PER:Individual
on O
the O
ticket O
again O
. O

Did O
they B-PER:Group
ever O
do O
that O
one O
? O

That O
's O
n O
- O
the O
- O
that O
's O
happened O
before O
, O
has O
n't O
it O
, O
where O
someone B-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
was I-PER:Individual
defeated I-PER:Individual
ran O
again O
? O

They B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
do O
it O
very O
often O
, O
probably O
just O
because O
they B-PER:Group
figure O
if O
he B-PER:Individual
lost O
once O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
'll O

Suzanne B-PER:Individual
Well O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
a B-PER:Individual
really I-PER:Individual
good I-PER:Individual
candidate I-PER:Individual
, O
and O
four O
more O
years O
could O
really O
help O
him B-PER:Individual
develop O
his B-PER:Individual
um O
-- O
could O
help O
him B-PER:Individual
develop O
-- O
hi O
- O
his B-PER:Individual
voting O
record O
especially O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
would O
help O
the O
Democratic B-ORG:Non-Governmental
ticket O
a O
lot O
. O

Sara B-PER:Individual
Right O
, O
because O
that O
's O
something O
he B-PER:Individual
got O
-- O
kind O
of O
-- O
uh O
-- O
got O
brought O
up O
a O
lot O
. O

Well O
, O
they B-PER:Group
-- O
let O
's B-PER:Indeterminate
see O
. O

Suzanne B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
like O
to O
s O
- O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
like O
to O
see O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
Greens I-ORG:Non-Governmental
run O
David B-PER:Individual
Cobb I-PER:Individual
again O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
have O
n't O
paid O
much O
attention O
to O
them B-ORG:Non-Governmental
, O
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
kind O
of O
looked O
at O
the O
-- O
the B-PER:Group
other I-PER:Group
listed I-PER:Group
candidates I-PER:Group
-- O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
figure O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
d O
- O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
d O
- O
none B-PER:Indeterminate
of I-PER:Indeterminate
them I-PER:Indeterminate
had O
enough O
support O
to O
get O
close O
, O
so O

Sara B-PER:Individual
um O
-- O
trying O
to O
think O
who B-PER:Group
else O
-- O
Arnold B-PER:Individual
Schwarzenegger I-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
-- O
well O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
not O
qualified O
anyway O
, O
but O

Suzanne B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
they B-PER:Group
might O
change O
something O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
between O
now O
and O
then O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
've O
heard O
people B-PER:Group
say O
that O
would O
take O
a O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
they B-PER:Group
will O
. O

uh O
That O
takes O
a O
Constitutional O
amendment O
. O

That O
's O
pretty O
hard O
to O
-- O
to O
get O
through O
. O

Well O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
you B-PER:Individual
live O
in O
California B-GPE:State-or-Province
. O

How O
is O
he B-PER:Individual
doing O
-- O
in O
your B-GPE:State-or-Province
state I-GPE:State-or-Province
? O

Oh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
done O
all O
right O
, O
um O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
-- O

He B-PER:Individual
's O
a O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
a B-PER:Individual
moderate I-PER:Individual
Republican I-PER:Individual
, O
you B-PER:Individual
know O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
not O

Sara B-PER:Individual
he B-PER:Individual
's O
not O
uh O
-- O
hard O
core O
Republican O
, O
so O
he B-PER:Individual
works O
pretty O
well O
with O
-- O
since O
this B-GPE:State-or-Province
is O
this B-GPE:State-or-Province

believe O

've O
never O
had O
a B-PER:Individual

a I-PER:Individual
major I-PER:Individual
candidate I-PER:Individual

It O
's O
got O

going O
to O
be O
the B-PER:Individual

think O

g O
- O
actually O
going O

herself B-PER:Individual
. O

was O
actually O

Suzanne B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
like O
to O
see O

And O
she B-PER:Individual
's O
she B-PER:Individual
's O
not O
too O
hard O

core O
Republican B-ORG:Non-Governmental
. O

This O
-- O
This O
uh O
-- O
last O
election O
being O
just O
over O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
had O
n't O
really O
started O
thinking O
much O
about O
the O
next O
one O
. O

Do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
any B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group

see O
him B-PER:Individual
win O

but O
then O

I B-PER:Individual
was O
a O
little O
bit O
surprised O
when O
he B-PER:Individual
won O
California B-GPE:State-or-Province
, O
so O

much O
flack O
he B-PER:Individual
got O
. O

Like O
I B-PER:Individual
just O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
like O
the O
idea O
of O
bringing O
in O
somebody B-PER:Individual

B B-PER:Individual
with O
a O
-- O
fresh O
, O
with O
a O
different O
perspective O
, O
who B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
already O
just O
part O
of O
that O
whole O
political O
wheel O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
because O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
by O
the O
time O
they B-PER:Group
get O
to O
office O
, O
it O
really O
does O
n't O
really O
matter O
who B-PER:Indeterminate
is O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O

A B-PER:Individual
Yeah O

still O
under O
the O
gun O
of O
the O
same O
big O

A B-PER:Individual
corporate B-ORG:Commercial
giants I-ORG:Commercial
or O
whatever O
. O

Well O

that O
's O
right O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O

was I-PER:Individual
coming I-PER:Individual
from I-PER:Individual
a I-PER:Individual
really I-PER:Individual
different I-PER:Individual
perspective I-PER:Individual

out O
of O
the O
water O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
said O
, O
he B-PER:Individual

. O

I B-PER:Individual
was O
telling O
all B-PER:Group
my I-PER:Group
friends I-PER:Group
. O

I B-PER:Individual
said O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
before O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
said O
, O
well O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
thought O
you B-PER:Individual
supported O
George B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
said O
, O
well O
I B-PER:Individual
did O
support O
George B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
, O
but O
he B-PER:Individual
does O
n't O
know O
what O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
doing O
and O
he B-PER:Individual
needs O
to O
go O
. O

And O
uh O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
says O
vote O
for O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
vote O
for O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
vote O
for O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
. O

And O
they B-PER:Group
voted O
for O
Jerry B-PER:Individual
Brown I-PER:Individual
and O
all B-PER:Group
these I-PER:Group
crazy I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
. O

A B-PER:Individual
And O
I B-PER:Individual
says O
, O
you B-PER:Group
're O
just O
wasting O
your B-PER:Group
vote O
, O
why O
are O
you B-PER:Group
doing O
that O
? O

So O
I B-PER:Individual
went O
and O
volunteered O
for O
him B-PER:Individual
and O
everything O
, O
and O
-- O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
met O
Hillary B-PER:Individual
, O
and O
and O
Tipper B-PER:Individual
and O
Al B-PER:Individual
, O
and O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
almost O
got O
to O
meet O
him B-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
worked O
at O
the O
Democrats B-ORG:Non-Governmental
Convention O
and O
everything O
. O

And O
uh O
it O
was O
great O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
had O
a O
good O
time O
, O
and O
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental

A B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
and O
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental
fed O
us B-PER:Group
, O
and O
had O
a O
party O
for O
us B-PER:Group
, O
all O
that O
kind O
of O
stuff O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
. O

But O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
we B-GPE:Nation
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental
better O
go O
back O
to O
a B-PER:Individual
governor I-PER:Individual
from I-PER:Individual
like I-PER:Individual
uh I-PER:Individual

A B-PER:Individual
uh O
North B-GPE:State-or-Province
Carolina I-GPE:State-or-Province
, O
or O
like O
the B-PER:Individual
one I-PER:Individual
from I-PER:Individual
Kansas I-PER:Individual
. O

She B-PER:Individual
's O
very O
tall O
, O
she B-PER:Individual
reminds O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
of O
uh O
Christie B-PER:Individual
Whitman I-PER:Individual
, O
the B-PER:Individual
governor I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
New I-PER:Individual
Jersey I-PER:Individual
, O
remember O
her B-PER:Individual
? O

A B-PER:Individual
She B-PER:Individual
's O
tall O
, O
kind O
of O
-- O
mm O
bush O
-- O
butch O
. O

She B-PER:Individual
's O
uh O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
like O
she B-PER:Individual
played O
basketball O
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

Real O
smart O
, O
quiet O
- O
spoked O
but O
stern O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
. O

B B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
not O
not O
real O
feminine O
, O
yeah O
. O

And O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
she B-PER:Individual
she B-PER:Individual
can O
give O
that O
demeanor O
that O
people B-PER:Group
like O
in O
leaders B-PER:Group
, O
of O
being O
the O
big O

B B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
people B-PER:Group
want O
to O
feel O
secure O
, O
right O
? O

And O
who B-PER:Indeterminate
's O
in O
that O
position O
? O

They B-PER:Group
want O
to O
feel O
that O
they B-PER:Group
're O
trustworthy O
and O
honorable O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O

B B-PER:Individual
Clinton B-PER:Individual
did O
so O
many O
fantastic O
things O
during O
his B-PER:Individual
term O
in O
office O
, O
but O
he B-PER:Individual
shot O
himself B-PER:Individual
on O
the O
foot O
with O
all O
of O
his B-PER:Individual
personal O
garbage O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
overshadowed O
how O
brilliant O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
as O
President B-PER:Individual
. O

t O
- O
everyone B-PER:Group
's O
trying O
to O
stay O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
they O
're O
quite O
-- O
They O
they O
've O
gotten O
better O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
know O
the B-ORG:Commercial
bigger I-ORG:Commercial
companies I-ORG:Commercial
have O
tried O

a O
good O

also O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
i B-PER:Individual
- O
know O
who B-PER:Indeterminate
who B-PER:Indeterminate
really O
is O
in O
charge O
, O
uh O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
and O
and O
know O
who B-PER:Indeterminate
you B-PER:Indeterminate
have O
to O
answer O
to O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
years O
ago O
I B-PER:Individual
had O
a B-ORG:Commercial
company I-ORG:Commercial
that I-ORG:Commercial
was I-ORG:Commercial
, I-ORG:Commercial
uh I-ORG:Commercial
, I-ORG:Commercial
it I-ORG:Commercial
was I-ORG:Commercial
, I-ORG:Commercial
uh I-ORG:Commercial
, O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
a B-PER:Individual
subs I-PER:Individual
- I-PER:Individual
s I-PER:Individual
- I-PER:Individual
captive I-PER:Individual
sub-contractor I-PER:Individual
for I-PER:Individual
making I-PER:Individual
packaging I-PER:Individual
material I-PER:Individual
. O

And O
, O
um O
, O
there O
were O
a B-PER:Group
lot I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
salesmen I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
company I-PER:Group
, O
they B-PER:Group
had O
a O
tendency O
to O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
there O
was O
there O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
chain O
of O
command O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
might O
say O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
there O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
the B-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
was I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
uh I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
head I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
organization I-PER:Individual
. O

But O
, O
all B-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
salesmen I-PER:Group
-- O
used O
to O
come O
around O
and O
give O
orders O
, O
too O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
. O

So O
it O
made O
it O
kind O
of O
difficult O
for O
the O
m O
- O
for O
my B-PER:Group
employees I-PER:Group
, O
because O
they B-PER:Group
would O
the B-PER:Group
salesmen I-PER:Group
would O
be O
coming O
out O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
without O
consulting O
with O
the B-PER:Individual
one I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
was I-PER:Individual
in I-PER:Individual
charge I-PER:Individual
. O

They B-PER:Group
would O
just O
be O
coming O
out O
and O
giving O
orders O
when O
they B-PER:Group
should O
already O
went O
through O
him B-PER:Individual
. O

So O
it O
made O
it O
difficult O
. O

So O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
really O
important O
to O
h O
- O
have O
that O
really O
clear O
. O

That O
that O
there O
's O
some O
organized O
way O
to O
deal O
with O
, O
uh O
, O
problems O
and O
orders O
and O
things O
like O
that O
, O
and O
if O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
, O
then O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
go O
to O
the B-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
's I-PER:Individual
in I-PER:Individual
charge I-PER:Individual
and O
-- O
then O
they B-PER:Individual
can O
handle O
it O
. O

So O
, O
that O
was O
-- O
that O
that O
's O
just O
a O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
a O
-- O
previous O
, O
uh O
, O
type O
of O
work O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
had O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
and O
tha O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
's O
what O
they B-PER:Group
wanted O
us B-PER:Group
to O
talk O
about O
, O
too O
, O
right O
? O

Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
that O
's O
that O
's O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
just O
basically O
, O
is O
( O
( O
) O
) O
one O
of O
the O
things O
I B-PER:Individual
perceive O
is O
if O
- O
what O
kind O
of O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
environment O
is O
it O
, O
and O
is O
it O
inviting O
is O
it O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
all O
that O
they B-PER:Group
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
that O
's O
what O
they B-PER:Group
're O
aiming O
at O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
it O
's O
not O
a O
place O
where O
everybody B-PER:Group
trying O
to O
give O
instruction O
and O
everybody B-PER:Group
trying O
to O
do O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
. O

Uh O
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
for O
my B-PER:Individual
job O
is O
i O
- O
i O
- O
-- O
we B-ORG:Commercial
have O
us B-ORG:Commercial
a O
very O
diverse O
feel O
. O

We B-ORG:Commercial
have O
a B-PER:Group
lot I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
who I-PER:Group
are I-PER:Group
from I-PER:Group
different I-PER:Group
country I-PER:Group
, O
and O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
and O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
they B-ORG:Commercial
are O
pretty O
much O
accepting O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
- O
bas O
- O
basically O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
can O
promote O
yourself B-PER:Indeterminate
if O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
do O
a O
good O
job O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
they B-ORG:Commercial
do O
n't O
pick O
and O
choose O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
. O

It O
's O
a O
very O
-- O
environment O
that O
allows O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
to O
grow O
in O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
they B-ORG:Commercial
thinks O

I B-PER:Individual
rightfully O
do O
n't O
, O
if O
-- O
like O
if O
I B-PER:Individual
have O
a O
problem O
, O
like O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'll O
freshly O
go O
to O
my B-PER:Individual
team I-PER:Individual
lead I-PER:Individual
or O
the B-PER:Individual
supervisor I-PER:Individual
and O
she B-PER:Individual
takes O
it O
to O
her B-PER:Individual
boss I-PER:Individual
, O
and O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
the B-PER:Individual
boss I-PER:Individual
takes O
it O
to O
the O
next O
level O
and O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
something O
like O
that O
. O

Yeah O
, O
but O
that O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
feel O
like O
that O
that O
's O
very O
important O
. O

Uh O
, O
for O
a B-ORG:Commercial
company I-ORG:Commercial
to O
be O
well O
- O
run O
, O
it B-ORG:Commercial
has O
to O
have O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
c O
- O
it B-ORG:Commercial
's O
t O
- O
has O
to O
be O
able O
to O
send O
a O
clear O
message O
-- O
as O
to O
how O
to O
handle O
problems O
and O
who B-PER:Indeterminate
who B-PER:Indeterminate
is O
the B-PER:Indeterminate
one I-PER:Indeterminate
that I-PER:Indeterminate
's I-PER:Indeterminate
uh I-PER:Indeterminate
, I-PER:Indeterminate
uh I-PER:Indeterminate
, I-PER:Indeterminate

for I-PER:Indeterminate
those I-PER:Indeterminate
problems I-PER:Indeterminate

And O
and O
people B-PER:Group
-- O
those B-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
company I-PER:Group
need O
to O
be O

to O
know O
wh O
- O
where O
their B-PER:Group
relative O
place O
is O
in O
the B-ORG:Commercial
company I-ORG:Commercial
. O

So O
that O
they B-PER:Group
they B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
overstep O
their B-PER:Group
bounds O
. O

Bill B-PER:Individual
Because O

predominantly O
a B-ORG:Commercial
Hispanic I-ORG:Commercial
run I-ORG:Commercial
organization I-ORG:Commercial
. O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
Hispanic B-PER:Group
, O
but O
they B-PER:Group
uh O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
hired O
uh O

Diane B-PER:Individual
a B-PER:Group
couple I-PER:Group
that B-PER:Group

let O
them B-PER:Group
-- O
recommend O
family B-PER:Group
members I-PER:Group
and O
friends B-PER:Group
, O
and O
that O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
a O
really O
-- O
good O
setup O
, O
because O
they B-PER:Group
're O
-- O
recommending O
people B-PER:Group
that B-PER:Group
they B-PER:Group
know O
work O

thinks O
whether O
she B-PER:Individual
thinks O
I B-PER:Individual

hire O
somebody B-PER:Indeterminate

And O
I B-PER:Individual

a B-PER:Group
really I-PER:Group

And O

the B-PER:Individual
Governor I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
Pennsylvania I-PER:Individual

A B-PER:Individual
And O
um O
after O
uh O

A B-PER:Individual
he B-PER:Individual
before O
nine O
eleven O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
was O

to I-ORG:Government
the I-ORG:Government

I I-ORG:Government
guess I-ORG:Government
, O
besides O
him B-PER:Individual
running O
uh O
Pennsylvania B-GPE:State-or-Province

, O
head B-Job-Title
of I-Job-Title
Homeland I-Job-Title
Security I-Job-Title

the O

A B-PER:Individual
uh O
Secretary B-PER:Individual
's O
position O
for O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
or O
for O
someone B-PER:Individual
, O
but O
him B-PER:Individual
being O
the B-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
at I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
time I-PER:Individual
. O

A B-PER:Individual
it O
's O
so O
soon O
-- O
since O
nine O
eleven O
, O
and O
he B-PER:Individual
has O
been O
creating O
his B-PER:Individual
own O
job O
, O
i O
- O
in O
essence O
, O
because O
it O
's O
such O
a O
new O
position O
. O

But O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
-- O
it O
would O
've O
been O
-- O
better O
to O
have O
one B-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
like I-PER:Individual
continuing I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
hate O
to O
I B-PER:Individual
hate O
to O
change O
-- O
change O
horses O
there O
so O
quickly O
. O

Uh O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
that O
-- O
that O
-- O
job O
uh O
uh O
needs O
continuity O
-- O
for O
a O
while O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
m O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
at O
least O
until O
they B-PER:Group
get O

B B-PER:Individual
settled O
on O
what O
the O
job O
really O
is O
. O

A B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
well O
uh O
maybe O
maybe O
on O
one O
hand O
-- O
somebody B-PER:Individual
new I-PER:Individual
will O
bring O
a O
new O
perspective O
to O
it O
, O
which O
would O
-- O
be O
helpful O
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
still O
think O
that O

A B-PER:Individual
the B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
that I-PER:Group
are I-PER:Group
up I-PER:Group
for I-PER:Group
it I-PER:Group
-- O
there O
's O
some O
p O
- O

B B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
but O
if O
it O
's O
if O
the O
perspective O
is O
too O
new O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
that O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
because O
uh O
wholesale O
changes O
is O
not O
what O
they B-PER:Group
need O
to O
do O
. O

Uh O
uh O
no O
matter O
who B-PER:Individual
takes O
it O
over O
. O

They B-PER:Group
need O
to O
they B-PER:Group
need O
to O
-- O
think O
long O
and O
hard O
before O
they B-PER:Group
start O
making O
changes O
. O

Because O
if O
they B-PER:Group
make O
one O
wrong O
one O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
it O

A B-PER:Individual
But O
there O
are O
there O
are O
a B-PER:Group
couple I-PER:Group
women I-PER:Group
up O
for O
-- O
the O
position O
as O
well O
as O
um O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
a B-PER:Group
few I-PER:Group
men I-PER:Group
that B-PER:Group
are O
up O
for O
the O
position O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O
the B-PER:Group
women I-PER:Group
that B-PER:Group
are O
up O
for O
the O
position O
. O

Um O
-- O
one O
-- O
two B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
men I-PER:Group
are O
from O
New B-GPE:Population-Center
York I-GPE:Population-Center
, O
one B-PER:Individual
is O
a B-PER:Individual
Head I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
was I-PER:Individual
there I-PER:Individual
at I-PER:Individual
nine I-PER:Individual
eleven I-PER:Individual
. O

He B-PER:Individual
was O
the B-PER:Individual
Chief I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
Police I-PER:Individual
. O

Or O
the B-PER:Individual
Commissioner I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
police I-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
. O

Uh O
who B-PER:Individual
was O
with O
Giuliani B-PER:Individual
throughout O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O

Um O
they B-PER:Group
're O
also O
thinking O
about O
Giuliani B-PER:Individual
, O
so O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
they B-PER:Group
have O
some B-PER:Group
qualified I-PER:Group
candidates I-PER:Group
. O

A B-PER:Individual
However O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
with O
it O
's O
Homeland B-ORG:Government
Security I-ORG:Government
, O
which O
means O
it O
ca O
n't O
just O
be O
New B-GPE:Population-Center
York I-GPE:Population-Center
, I-GPE:Population-Center
which I-GPE:Population-Center
is I-GPE:Population-Center
where I-GPE:Population-Center
of I-GPE:Population-Center
course I-GPE:Population-Center
, I-GPE:Population-Center
their I-GPE:Population-Center
focus I-GPE:Population-Center
is I-GPE:Population-Center
going I-GPE:Population-Center
to I-GPE:Population-Center
be I-GPE:Population-Center
. O

A B-PER:Individual
Having O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
been O
there B-GPE:Population-Center
, O
and O
through O
that O
. O

So O
, O
as O
long O
as O
they B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
have O
blinders O
on O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
would O
be O
okay O
with O
that O
, O
but O
they B-PER:Group
've O
got O
to O
look O
, O
obviously O
-- O
at O
ports B-FAC:Building-Grounds
-- O
nuclear B-FAC:Plant
power I-FAC:Plant
plants I-FAC:Plant
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
and O
oth O
- O
other O
areas O
where O
we B-GPE:Nation
are O
vulnerable O
. O

Yeah O
, O
and O
you B-PER:Individual
know O
what O
's O
really O
scary O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
? O

I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
never O
seen O
it O
mentioned O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
never O
-- O
but O
-- O
but O
if O
they B-PER:Group
really O
wanted O
to O
to O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
uh O
uh O
uh O
if O
they B-PER:Group
if O
they B-PER:Group
really O
wanted O
to O
put O
-- O
fear O
in O
the B-GPE:Nation
American I-GPE:Nation
people I-GPE:Nation
, O
uh O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
know O
it O
would O
work O
with O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
is O
if O
they B-PER:Group
say O
just O
uh O
if O
if O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
say O
they B-PER:Group
, O
Bin B-PER:Individual
Laden I-PER:Individual
, O
or O
who B-PER:Individual
whoever B-PER:Individual
-- O
uh O
-- O
uh O
is O
running O
that B-ORG:Non-Governmental
team I-ORG:Non-Governmental
now O
, O
uh O
were O
to O
-- O
were O
to O
just O
pick O
a B-GPE:Population-Center
small I-GPE:Population-Center
-- I-GPE:Population-Center
Mid I-GPE:Population-Center
- I-GPE:Population-Center
American I-GPE:Population-Center
town I-GPE:Population-Center
, O

B B-PER:Individual
uh O
and O
just O
wipe O
it B-GPE:Population-Center
out O
, O

A B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
no O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
thi O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
's O
a O
great O
fear O
. O

B B-PER:Individual
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
and O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
ways O
-- O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
ways O
to O
do O
that O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
it O
would O
n't O
take O
a B-WEA:Nuclear
nuclear I-WEA:Nuclear
weapon I-WEA:Nuclear
. O

B B-PER:Individual
uh O
uh O
and O
it O
it O
could O
be O
done O
so O
easily O
because O
i O
- O
i O
- O
most B-GPE:Population-Center
small I-GPE:Population-Center
towns I-GPE:Population-Center
are O
protected O
by O
a B-PER:Group
small I-PER:Group
town I-PER:Group
police I-PER:Group
force I-PER:Group
. O

A B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
-- O
there O
's O
-- O
really O
-- O
been O
a O
strengthening O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
hope O
they B-PER:Group
can O
-- O
get O
it O
together O
without O
this O
. O

Part O
of O
the O
problem O
with O
that O
is O
the B-ORG:Government
~ I-ORG:Government
CIA I-ORG:Government
and O
the B-ORG:Government
~ I-ORG:Government
FBI I-ORG:Government
and O
who B-PER:Individual
's O
going O
to O
be O
in O
charge O
because O
they B-PER:Group
want O
to O
create O
this O
new O
position O
. O

A B-PER:Individual
And O
, O
so O
nobody B-PER:Indeterminate
wants O
to O
-- O
give O
up O
-- O
power O

A B-PER:Individual
and O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
-- O
in O
this O
case O
, O
and O
and O
going O
forward O
, O
we B-GPE:Nation
have O
to O
put O
the O
good O
of O
-- O
the B-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation
-- O
and O
the O
good O
of O

this O
year O
when O

Oh O
thi O
- O
you B-PER:Individual

surprised O
that O

that O

uh O
with O
Condoleezza B-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual

Ashcroft B-PER:Individual
surprised O
me B-PER:Individual
a O
little O
bit O
um O
but O
um O
I B-PER:Individual
sort O
of O
started O
to O
think O
he B-PER:Individual
might O
step O
down O
because O
evidently O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
being O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
considered O
somewhat O
of O
a B-PER:Individual
lightning I-PER:Individual
rod I-PER:Individual
for O
um O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
some O
of O
his B-PER:Individual
more O
controversial O
stands O

we B-GPE:Nation
have O
a O
real O
problem O
. O

That O
is O
uh O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
almost O
like O
a O
big O
beast O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
that O
's O
right O
there O
and O
we B-GPE:Nation
do O
n't O
even O
identify O
it O

Sherri B-PER:Individual
way O
way O
way O
more O
than O
we B-GPE:Nation
realize O
. O

Ron B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
you B-PER:Individual
're O
probably O
right O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
-- O
maybe O
even O
particularly O
true O
under O
this B-PER:Individual
President I-PER:Individual
, O
although O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
just O
limited O
to O
him B-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
a O
common O
problem O
in O
the B-GPE:Nation
~ I-GPE:Nation
US I-GPE:Nation
. O

Sherri B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
f O
- O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
uh O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
i O
- O
i O
- O
it O
's O
uh O
more O
evident O
now O
than O
ever O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
really O
um O
-- O
tremen O
- O
tremendously O
a O
ruling O
and O
reigning O
. O

Sherri B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
it O
's O
a O
global O
uh O
has O
a O
global O
effect O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
's O
why O
Al B-ORG:Non-Governmental
- I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Qaeda I-ORG:Non-Governmental
-- O
took O
down O
the O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
uh I-FAC:Building-Grounds
twin I-FAC:Building-Grounds
towers I-FAC:Building-Grounds
. O

Eh O
w O
- O
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental
were O
making O
a O
a O
statement O
. O

Uh O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
something O
like O
that O
possibly O
, O
that O
it O
had O
to O
do O
with O
corporate B-PER:Group
America I-PER:Group
. O

Uh O
- O
huh O
, O
you B-PER:Individual
mean O
about O
the O
corporate O
thing O
? O

Uh O
you B-PER:Individual
mean O
because O
of O
its O
-- O
what O
it O
represented O
around O
corporate B-PER:Group
America I-PER:Group
or O
something O
? O

Is O
that O
what O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
what O
corporate B-PER:Group
America I-PER:Group
represents O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
the O
the O
financial O
scheme O
of O
it O
all O
, O
the O

Sherri B-PER:Individual
the O
it O
just O
how O
it O
eff O
- O
effects O
the B-LOC:Celestial
globe I-LOC:Celestial
, O

Sherri B-PER:Individual
and O
how O
eh O
it O
effects O
third B-GPE:Nation
world I-GPE:Nation
countries I-GPE:Nation
and O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
just O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O

Sherri B-PER:Individual
it O
's O
a O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
like O
a O
a O
a O
wealthy O
despotism O
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

So O
any O
thoughts O
on O
who B-PER:Indeterminate
you B-PER:Individual
uh O
you B-PER:Individual
would O
name O
? O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
who B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
would O
name O
? O

I B-PER:Individual
know O
this O
is O
really O
wild O
. O

But O
uh O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
you B-PER:Individual
'll O
probably O
really O
laugh O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
always O
thought O
that O
-- O
Ralph B-PER:Individual
Nader I-PER:Individual
was O
kind O
of O
a O
a B-PER:Individual
character I-PER:Individual

Sherri B-PER:Individual
but O
what O
I B-PER:Individual
really O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
I B-PER:Individual
really O
listened O
to O
what O
he B-PER:Individual
said O
when O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
being O
interviewed O

Sherri B-PER:Individual
and O
in O
just O
a O
few O
words O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
mince O
any O
meat O
or O
anything O
, O
in O
a O
few O
words O
he B-PER:Individual
said O
so O
much O
that O
was O
so O

Sherri B-PER:Individual
like O
-- O
like O
a O
clarion O
call O
it O
rang O
so O
clear O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
could O
hear O
what O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
saying O
and O
it O
was O
really O
making O
sense O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
an O
expert O

So O
who B-PER:Individual
would O
y B-PER:Individual
- O
what O
would O
you B-PER:Individual
appoint O
him B-PER:Individual
to O
? O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
's O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

Sherri B-PER:Individual
eh O
-- O
there O
's O
something O
to O
do O
with O
the O
economy O
y O
- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
for O
the O
with O
the O
to O
deal O
with O
the O

Sherri B-PER:Individual
just O
uh O
-- O
like O
a O
an O
equa O
- O
e O
- O
economic O
equilibrium O
or O
something O
. O

He B-PER:Individual
might O
be O
be O
good O
at O
-- O
yeah O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
might O
be O
good O
at O
commerce O
instead O
of O
that B-PER:Individual
Kellogg I-PER:Individual
's I-PER:Individual
guy I-PER:Individual
. O

Bush O
Cabinet O
President B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
has O
just O
been O
elected O
to O
another O
term O
in O
office O
, O
and O
he B-PER:Individual
has O
already O
started O
to O
appoint O
new B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
to O
his B-PER:Group
political I-PER:Group
cabinet I-PER:Group
as O
current B-PER:Group
members I-PER:Group
like I-PER:Group
Colin I-PER:Group
Powell I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
John I-PER:Group
Ashcroft I-PER:Group

you B-PER:Indeterminate
like O
to O
see O
appointed O
to O
his B-PER:Group
cabinet I-PER:Group
next O
term O
? O

Who B-PER:Indeterminate
are O
they B-PER:Indeterminate
, O
and O
why O
do O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
think O
they B-PER:Indeterminate
should O
be O
appointed O
? O

If O
you B-PER:Indeterminate

president O
, O
which O
national B-PER:Group
figures I-PER:Group
would O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
appoint O

your B-PER:Group
cabinet I-PER:Group
and O
why O
? O

What O
new O
cabinet B-PER:Group
positions O
would O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
create O

who B-PER:Indeterminate
would O
fill O
them O
? O

really O
know O
that O
much O
about O
him B-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual

kind O
of O
the B-PER:Individual
first I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
one I-PER:Individual
on I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual

security I-PER:Individual
or I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
in I-PER:Individual
charge I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
. O

But O
I B-PER:Individual
heard O
that O
they B-PER:Group
were O
going O
to O
-- O
one B-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
possible I-PER:Individual
candidates I-PER:Individual

be O
the B-PER:Individual
chief I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
police I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
New I-PER:Individual

somebody B-PER:Individual
to I-PER:Individual
me I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
's I-PER:Individual
going I-PER:Individual
to I-PER:Individual
have I-PER:Individual
some I-PER:Individual
good I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
insight I-PER:Individual
into I-PER:Individual

-- I-PER:Individual
keep I-PER:Individual
a I-PER:Individual
city I-PER:Individual
secure I-PER:Individual
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate

A B-PER:Individual
has O
has O
has O
got O
some O
-- O
different O
rules O
from O
Texas B-GPE:State-or-Province
as O
far O
as O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
running O
the B-GPE:Population-Center
city I-GPE:Population-Center
. O

I B-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual
, O
there O
's O
a B-PER:Group
lot I-PER:Group
lot I-PER:Group
more I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
dense O
population O
up O
there B-GPE:Population-Center
than O
there O
is O
in O
in O
Texas B-GPE:State-or-Province
and O
they B-PER:Group
probably O
would O
have O
uh O
the O
pol O
- O
uh O
the B-PER:Individual
police I-PER:Individual
chief I-PER:Individual
would O
probably O
know O
-- O
well O
what O
can O
work O
in O
like O
, O
airports B-FAC:Airport
or O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
things O
, O
situations O
like O
that O
. O

He B-PER:Individual
was O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
a B-PER:Individual
pretty I-PER:Individual
good I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
pretty I-PER:Individual
smart I-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
. O

But O
I B-PER:Individual
, O
it O
did O
n't O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
ca O
n't O
remember O
his B-PER:Individual
name O
, O
but O
-- O
the O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
saw O
an O
interview O
with O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
and O
-- O
how O
he B-PER:Individual
, O
uh O
-- O
ran O
New B-GPE:Population-Center
York I-GPE:Population-Center
and O
uh O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
some O
of O
the O
-- O
ru O
- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
they B-PER:Group
changed O
some O
of O
the O
rules O
, O
uh O
-- O
uh O
, O
not O
rules O
, O
but O
the O
way O
they B-PER:Group
-- O
uh O

The O
the B-ORG:Government
police I-ORG:Government
kind O
of O
changed O
their B-ORG:Government
tactics O
and O
, O
because O
there O
was O
a B-LOC:Region-General
lot I-LOC:Region-General
of I-LOC:Region-General
-- I-LOC:Region-General
oh I-LOC:Region-General
-- I-LOC:Region-General
run I-LOC:Region-General
down I-LOC:Region-General
areas I-LOC:Region-General
, O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
crime O
and O
they B-PER:Group
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
-- O
got O
-- O
cleaned O
it B-GPE:Population-Center
up O
, O
and O
and O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
passed O
some O
laws O
that O
said O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
could O
n't O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
was O
like O
, O
um O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
like O
homeless B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
that B-PER:Group
-- O
carrying O
-- O
uh O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
shopping O
carts O
, O
or O
something O
like O
that O
, O
and O
it O
sounds O
-- O
small O
-- O
to O
outlaw O
that O
. O

But O
they B-PER:Group
outlawed O
that O
because O
they B-PER:Group
said O
a B-PER:Group
lot I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
were O
stealing O
stuff O
. O

They B-PER:Group
'd O
stick O
them O
in O
the O
shopping O
carts O
and O
push O
them O
down O
the B-FAC:Path
road I-FAC:Path
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
would O
n't O
know O
, O
oh O
, O
they B-PER:Individual
're O
just O
a B-PER:Individual
homeless I-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
. O

Well O
they B-PER:Group
cut O
that O
out O
and O
they B-PER:Group
found O
out O
-- O
it O
cut O
down O
on O
the O
theft O
. O

Uh O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
people B-PER:Group
-- O
hide O
them O
in O
their B-PER:Group
basket O
and O
-- O
or O
taking O
something O
and O
then O
stick O
in O
their B-PER:Group
basket O
and O
the B-ORG:Government
police I-ORG:Government
never O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
bothered O
them B-PER:Group
. O

Well O
, O
the B-PER:Group
homeless I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
, O
they B-PER:Group
need O
their B-PER:Group
shopping O
cart O
, O
so O
they B-PER:Group
kind O
of O
went O
elsewhere B-LOC:Region-General
, O
so O
-- O
um O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
it O
's O
a O
small O
thing O
, O
but O
it O
was O
, O
they B-PER:Indeterminate
just O
figured O
out O
, O
they B-PER:Indeterminate
were O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
uh O
-- O
learning O
from O
experience O
on O
what O
they B-PER:Indeterminate
need O
to O
do O
in O
the B-GPE:Population-Center
-- I-GPE:Population-Center
city I-GPE:Population-Center
and O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
would O
be O
a B-PER:Individual
good I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
candidate I-PER:Individual
for I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
Homeland I-PER:Individual
Security I-PER:Individual
, O
running O
that O
. O

But O
, O
eh O
, O
for O
the O
foreign O
po O
- O
uh O
this O
is O
all O
all O
what O
you B-PER:Individual
are O
saying O
is O
like O
, O
about O
the O
internal O
-- O
but O
what O
about O
the O
external O
policy O
or O
something O
like O
that O
? O

Whom B-PER:Individual
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
would O
be O
suitable O
? O

B B-PER:Individual
Like O
, O
eh O
, O
foreign O
po O

or O
international O
policy O
or O

or O

B B-PER:Individual
uh O
, O
whom B-PER:Individual
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
would O
be O
suitable O
for O
this O
position O
? O

A B-PER:Individual
To O
run O
foreign O
policy O
? O

Um O
-- O
like O
, O
uh O
-- O
well O
, O
it O
was O
-- O
Colin B-PER:Individual
Powell I-PER:Individual
was O
Secretary B-PER:Individual
, O
was O
he B-PER:Individual
Secretary B-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
State I-PER:Individual
? O

Is O
that O
what O
that O
was O
? O

A B-PER:Individual
And O
Condoleezza B-PER:Individual
Rice I-PER:Individual
is O
going O
to O
step O
into O
that O
position O
, O
the O
way O
I B-PER:Individual
understand O
it O
, O
uh O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
she B-PER:Individual
may O
be O
-- O
uh O
uh O
uh O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
uh O
-- O
a B-PER:Individual
uh I-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
yes I-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
, O
uh O

B B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
this O
will O
change O
too O
much O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
. O

A B-PER:Individual
well O
mo B-PER:Group
- I-PER:Group
most I-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
most I-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
aides I-PER:Group
to I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
President I-PER:Group
, O
if O
it O
was O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
when O
it O
was O
Clinton B-PER:Individual
it O
was O
, O
they B-PER:Group
'd O
probably O
be O
kind O
of O
yes B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
too O
, O
but O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
they B-PER:Individual
pick O
the B-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
to I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
you I-PER:Individual
know I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
help I-PER:Individual
them I-PER:Individual
and O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
they B-PER:Individual
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
have O
-- O
philosophies O
and O
and O
-- O
run O
it O
the O
way O
they B-PER:Individual
would O
or O
way O
they B-PER:Individual
'd O
want O
, O
uh O

B B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
actually O
I B-PER:Individual
agree O
with O
you B-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
uh O
-- O
during O
, O
uh O
, O
Clinton B-PER:Individual
time O
uh O
-- O
the O
uh O
like O
international O
policy O
or O
the O
external O
policy O
was O
-- O
was O
much O
better O
than O
-- O
uh O
what O
what O
is O
happening O
right O
now O
, O
so O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
if O
we B-PER:Indeterminate
took O
Bill B-PER:Individual
Clin I-PER:Individual
- I-PER:Individual
Bill I-PER:Individual
Clinton I-PER:Individual
as O
like O
, O
as O
a O
foreign O
policy O
-- O

He B-PER:Individual
he B-PER:Individual
would O
be O
he B-PER:Individual
will O
do O
a O
very O
good O
job O
. O

Uh O
, O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
there O
is O
uh O
-- O
some O
other O
, O
uh O
like O
-- O
positions O
has O
to O
be O
has O
been O
-- O
has O
to O
be O
created O
, O
like O
uh O
-- O
for O
the O
next O
election O
. O

A B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
s O
- O
-- O
say O
that O
again O
. O

I B-PER:Individual

you B-PER:Individual
who O

would O
you B-PER:Individual
-- O
well O
what O
about O
Ruly O
-- O
Rudolph B-PER:Individual
Giuliani I-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
Rudy B-PER:Individual
Giuliani I-PER:Individual
was O
a B-PER:Individual
great I-PER:Individual
mayor I-PER:Individual
-- O
for O
nine O
eleven O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
a B-PER:Individual
great I-PER:Individual
mayor I-PER:Individual
the O
whole O
time O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
a B-PER:Individual
mayor I-PER:Individual
. O

A B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
a B-PER:Individual
New I-PER:Individual
Yorker I-PER:Individual
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
got O
to O
tell O
you B-PER:Individual
that O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
nine O
eleven O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
basically O
made O
him B-PER:Individual
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
a O
little O
too O
decisive O
. O

A B-PER:Individual
Uh O
not O
I B-PER:Individual
should O
n't O
say O
decisive O
, O
too O
divisive O
. O

A B-PER:Individual
As O
far O
as O
-- O
the O
race O
relationship O
in O
this B-GPE:Population-Center
city I-GPE:Population-Center
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
much O
to O
to O
please O
-- O
the B-PER:Group
other I-PER:Group
side I-PER:Group
. O

And O
that O
and O
that O
's O
what O
government B-ORG:Government
is O
all O
about O
. O

A B-PER:Individual
And O
he B-PER:Individual
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
too O
much O
of O
a O
good O
uh O

He B-PER:Individual
he B-PER:Individual
would O
've O
gone O
out O
as O
a B-PER:Individual
mediocre I-PER:Individual
mayor I-PER:Individual
had O
it O
not O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
but O
even O
even O
saying O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
ca O
n't O
begrudge O
him B-PER:Individual
. O

But O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
a O
great O
job O
in O
the O
crisis O
. O

Some B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
do O
better O
in O
crises O
. O

Exactly O
, O
exactly O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
nine O
eleven O
made O
him B-PER:Individual
and O

A B-PER:Individual
and O
at O
that O
point O
in O
time O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
wanted O
to O
stay O
on O
, O
which O
was O
sort O
of O
sort O
of O
ridiculous O
. O

And O
if O
if O
if O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
the B-PER:Group
rest I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
country I-PER:Group
knows O
that O
, O
because O
they B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
know O
what O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
before O
nine O
eleven O
, O
because O
they B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
pay O
any O
attention O
. O

Exactly O
, O
of O
course O
, O
you B-PER:Individual
're O
right O
, O
you B-PER:Individual
're O
quite O
right O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
if O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
get O
a B-ORG:Government
government I-ORG:Government
agency I-ORG:Government
, O
it B-ORG:Government
would O
have O
to O
be O
one B-ORG:Government
that I-ORG:Government
was I-ORG:Government
having I-ORG:Government
crisis I-ORG:Government
a I-ORG:Government
lot I-ORG:Government
of I-ORG:Government
times I-ORG:Government
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
would O
just O
have O
to O
devote O
himself B-PER:Individual
to O
that O
. O

If O
he B-PER:Individual
could O
just O
do O
that O
, O
it O
would O
be O
fine O
. O

But O
if O
he B-PER:Individual
gets O
if O
gets O
into O
a O
lot O
of O
policy O
making O
and O
stuff O
that O
for O
other O
things O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O

Yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
know O
I B-PER:Individual
one O
of O
the O

Probably O
would O
be O
a B-PER:Individual
good I-PER:Individual
attorney I-PER:Individual
general I-PER:Individual
, O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
that O

A B-PER:Individual
it O
could O
very O
well O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
a O
good O
job O
, O
you B-PER:Individual
're O
right O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
probably O
could O
follow O
in O
what B-PER:Individual
's I-PER:Individual
his I-PER:Individual
name I-PER:Individual
's O
footsteps O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
the O
cases O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
picks O
and O
chooses O
probably O
I B-PER:Individual
would O
n't O
necessarily O
put O
on O
top O
of O
the O
list O
, O
but O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
seem O
to O

That O
much O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
we B-PER:Group
can O
we B-PER:Group
can O
probably O
agree O
with O
. O

He B-PER:Individual
will O
probably O
do O
that O
evenly O
. O

A B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
you B-PER:Individual
know O
who B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
thought O
would O
have O
made O
a O
great O
, O
uh O
well O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
know O
you B-GPE:State-or-Province
guys I-GPE:State-or-Province
had O
your B-GPE:State-or-Province
own O
political O
uh O
struggles O
in O
Jersey B-GPE:State-or-Province
. O

A B-PER:Individual
oh O

certainly O
was O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
saw O
the O
footage O
. O

B B-PER:Individual
Right O
, O
right O
, O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
. O

Within O
one O
day O
, O
everybody B-PER:Group
I I-PER:Group
met I-PER:Group

national O
thing O
to O
say O
in O
Jersey B-GPE:State-or-Province
, O
and O
in O
Jersey B-GPE:State-or-Province
. O

Like O
, O
everybody B-PER:Group
knew O
it O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
be O
like O
, O
you B-PER:Group
did O
not O
. O

Yeah O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
on O
a O
cruise O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
put O
on O
the O
television O
uh O
when O
I B-PER:Individual
got O
in O
at O
the O
six O
oh O
clock O
news O
, O
and O
bingo O
, O
there O
he B-PER:Individual
is O
, O
uh O
resigning O
as O
Governor B-Job-Title
of I-Job-Title
uh I-Job-Title
New I-Job-Title
Jersey I-Job-Title
. O

I B-PER:Individual
said O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
've O
got O
to O
be O
kidding O
me B-PER:Individual
. O

A B-PER:Individual
But O
uh O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
thought O
he B-PER:Individual
would O
have O
made O
a O
name O
for O
himself B-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
ca O
n't O
think O
of O
anyone B-PER:Individual
anyone B-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
anyone B-PER:Individual
else I-PER:Individual
out I-PER:Individual
there I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
um I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
warrants I-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
just O

A B-PER:Individual
pick O
people B-PER:Group
who I-PER:Group
I I-PER:Group
think I-PER:Group
will I-PER:Group
uh I-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
have I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
experience I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
government I-PER:Group
. O

Well O
not O
in O
, O
not O
in O
government B-ORG:Government
, O
but O
in O
the O
private O
sector O
. O

Um O
-- O
who B-PER:Group
are O
responsible O
, O
and O
um O
-- O
put O
them B-PER:Group
in O
a O
position O
to O
lead O
. O

Well O
, O
Yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
uh O
-- O
apparently O
-- O
the B-PER:Individual
President I-PER:Individual
likes O
people B-PER:Indeterminate
that I-PER:Indeterminate
are I-PER:Indeterminate
the I-PER:Indeterminate
same I-PER:Indeterminate
philo I-PER:Indeterminate
- I-PER:Indeterminate
-- I-PER:Indeterminate
political I-PER:Indeterminate
philosophy I-PER:Indeterminate
as I-PER:Indeterminate
him I-PER:Indeterminate
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
sure O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
just O
needs O
some O
other O
voices O
in O
there O
, O
but O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
'll O
happen O
. O

A B-PER:Individual
That O
's O
a O
good O
point O
. O

He B-PER:Individual
he B-PER:Individual
needs O
some B-PER:Group
liberals I-PER:Group
in O
there B-PER:Group
and O
he B-PER:Individual
needs O
some B-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
Ralph I-PER:Group
Nader I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
, O
and O
some B-PER:Group
Green I-PER:Group
Party I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
, O
and O
some O
, O
just O
some B-PER:Group
. O

A B-PER:Individual
Well O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
more O
conservative O
, O
what O
do O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
call O
them B-PER:Group

Conservative O
uh O
-- O
um O
-- O

oh O
bloody O
he O
- O

A B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
yeah O
well O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
could O
look O
at O
it O
that O
way O
, O
yeah O
. O

A B-PER:Individual
Um O
. O
Um O
. O
I B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
particularly O
like O
the O
the O
tone O
about O
the O
the O
religious O
uh O
-- O
side O
of O
-- O
the O
that O
election O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
thought O
that O
was O
a O
little O
crazy O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
pretty O
wack O
. O

A B-PER:Individual
If O
it O
's O
one O
thing O
we B-GPE:Nation
need O
to O
be O
careful O
about O
, O
it O
's O
separating O
the B-ORG:Religious
Church I-ORG:Religious
from O

B B-PER:Individual
Exactly O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
a B-PER:Individual
pastor I-PER:Individual

and O
that O
bothers O
me B-PER:Individual
. O

A B-PER:Individual
and O

pastor I-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
says I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
we B-GPE:Nation
need O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
that O
that O

A B-PER:Individual
that O
stays O
the O
way O
it O
is O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
serves O
everyone B-GPE:Nation
well O
. O

Well O
, O
for O
one O
thing O
, O
it O
it O
ends O
up O
as O

Okay O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
have O
been O
following O
the O
trial O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
why O

ever O
since O
this O
whole O
thing O
happened O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
am O
a B-PER:Individual
stay I-PER:Individual
at I-PER:Individual
home I-PER:Individual
mom I-PER:Individual
, O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
get O
to O

more O
often O

I B-PER:Individual
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O

what O
I B-PER:Individual
see O
is O
that O
there O
is O
no O
physical O
evidence O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
it O
. O

And O
yeah O
, O
it O
sounds O
like O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
do O
it O
because O
he B-PER:Individual
dyed O
his B-PER:Individual
hair O
, O
was O
trying O
to O
get O
away O
, O

the O

I B-PER:Individual
for O
some O
reason O

deep O
down O
in O
my B-PER:Individual
heart O
, O
do O
n't O
believe O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
it O
. O

And O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
the B-ORG:Media
media I-ORG:Media
made O
him B-PER:Individual
guilty O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
it O
's O
like O
you B-PER:Indeterminate

, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
you B-PER:Individual
saw O
what O

Greg B-PER:Individual
Well O
-- O
Yeah O
, O
no O
I B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
( O
( O
the B-PER:Individual
guy I-PER:Individual
's O
) O
) O
definitely O
guilty O
uh O
Just O
based O
on O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
have O
n't O
followed O
it O
all O
that O
closely O
, O
although O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
ca O
n't O
help O
but O
follow O
it O
closely O
because O
there O
's O
so O
much O
crap O
on O
the O
news O
. O

But O
uh O
no O
i B-PER:Individual
- O
the O
-- O
uh O
the O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
well O
first O
of O
all O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
I B-PER:Individual
agree O
with O
you B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
cheating O
on O
your B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
's O
pretty O
low O
. O

But O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
what O
happened O
i O
- O
it O
's O
living O
the O
b O
- O
uh O
living O
large O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
could O
tell O
both B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
them I-PER:Group
uh O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
look O
some O
of O
the O
things O
they B-PER:Group
had O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
a B-Numeric:Money
few I-Numeric:Money
bucks I-Numeric:Money
or I-Numeric:Money
so I-Numeric:Money
. O
( O
( O
) O
) O
finish O
, O
things O
were O
getting O
him B-PER:Individual
down O
, O
uh O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
how O
it O
is O
, O
day O
after O
day O
though O
-- O
M O
- O
marriage O
is O
n't O
all O
that O
wonderful O
. O

Eh O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
faced O
that O
, O
and O
plus O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
neat O
stuff O
from O
the O
outside O
, O
and O
particularly O
Amber B-PER:Individual
Frey I-PER:Individual
, O
who B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
particularly O
think O
is O
neat O
, O
but O
it O
was O
something O
that O
uh O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
he B-PER:Individual
went O
after O

Greg B-PER:Individual
and O
so O
uh O
he B-PER:Individual
figured O
, O
well O
-- O
these O
will O
, O
these O
things O
would O
get O
rid O
of O
her B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
why O
like O
his B-PER:Individual
uh O
, O
the B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
's O
or O
the B-PER:Individual
mother I-PER:Individual
said O
divorce O
is O
an O
option O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
know O
, O
that O
's O
very O
powerful O
. O

Not O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
not O
murder O
and O
, O
oh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
. O

But O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
can O
see O
, O
the B-PER:Individual
guy I-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
thinking O
right O
. O

He B-PER:Individual
was O
screwed O
up O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
a B-PER:Individual
despicable I-PER:Individual
human I-PER:Individual
being I-PER:Individual
and O
he B-PER:Individual
, O
just O
-- O
You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
the O
easy O
way O
out O
. O

This O
'll O
work O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
guarantee O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
too O
damn O
smart O
. O

But O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
what O
, O
it O
's O
like O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
they B-PER:Group
did O
n't O
want O
to O
find O
him B-PER:Individual
guilty O
because O
remember O
when O
~ O
OJ B-PER:Individual
was O
not O
found O
guilty O
? O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
oh O
my B-PER:Individual
God B-PER:Individual
, O
the O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
but O
it O
's O
like O
, O
~ O
LA B-GPE:Population-Center
would O
have O
like O
, O
turned O
~ O
LA B-GPE:Population-Center
upside O
down O
, O
like O
all O
the O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O

Christina B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
- O
it O
just O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
found O
guilty O
, O
but O
now O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
they B-PER:Group
said O
that O
they B-PER:Group
wanted O
to O
prove O
that O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
okay O
, O
we B-PER:Group
're O
not O
going O
to O
let O
this B-PER:Individual
guy I-PER:Individual
walk O
, O
like O
, O
do O
n't O
let O
this B-PER:Individual
guy I-PER:Individual
walk O
either O
, O
big O
high O
profile O
case O
. O

Well O
, O
yeah O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
have O
to O
look O
, O
see O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
the O
locale O
, O
that O
both O
of O
them O
took O
place O
, O
and O
one O
took O
place O
in O
~ O
LA B-GPE:Population-Center
, O
which O
is O
terribly O
open O
- O
minded O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
other O
one O
took O
place O
in O
uh O
, O
Mida O
- O
well O
, O
uh O
( O
( O
Redoak B-GPE:Population-Center
) I-GPE:Population-Center
) I-GPE:Population-Center
City I-GPE:Population-Center
. O

And O
who O
, O
Redwood B-GPE:Population-Center
City I-GPE:Population-Center
is O
one O
of O
those O
things O
that O
would O
, O
uh O
shift O
San B-GPE:Population-Center
Francisco I-GPE:Population-Center
and O
~ O
LA B-GPE:Population-Center
to O
, O
uh O
, O
to O
a B-GPE:State-or-Province
red I-GPE:State-or-Province
state I-GPE:State-or-Province
rather O
than O
a B-GPE:State-or-Province
blue I-GPE:State-or-Province
state I-GPE:State-or-Province
if O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
let O
them B-GPE:Population-Center
. O

It O
's O
very O
, O
very O
conservative O
there B-GPE:Population-Center

Scott B-PER:Individual
Peterson I-PER:Individual
trial O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
I B-PER:Individual
- O
I B-PER:Individual
, O
uh O
, O
actually O
picked O
to O
do O
this O
one O
is O
I B-PER:Individual
lived O
in O
Redwood B-GPE:Population-Center
City I-GPE:Population-Center
, O
so O
. O

A B-PER:Individual
Um O
, O
it B-GPE:Population-Center
's O
northern B-LOC:Region-General
California I-LOC:Region-General
. O

A B-PER:Individual
Where O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
like O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual

argument O
with O

he B-PER:Individual
pushed O

hit O
her B-PER:Individual
head O
or O
something O
and O
it O
killed O
her B-PER:Individual

of O
the O
crimes O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
been O
convicted O
of O
? O

If O
so O
, O
what O
were O
his B-PER:Individual
motives O
? O

How O
closely O
did O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
follow O
the O
trial O
and O
what O
do O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
think O
of O
all O
of O
the O
media B-ORG:Media
coverage O
of O
the O
trial O
? O

What O
kind O
of O
sentencing O
should O
Peterson B-PER:Individual
receive O
? O

Hi O
, O
my B-PER:Individual
name O
is O
Hillary O
. O

Could O
you B-PER:Individual
hold O
on O
for O
a O
second O
? O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
a O
pretty O
-- O
depressing O
topic O
for O
today O
. O

Kelly B-PER:Individual
yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
so O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
really O
, O
uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
really O
know O
much O
about O
that O
topic O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
really O
follow O
the O
trial O
very O
closely O
at O
all O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
we B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
have O
, O
uh O
, O
cable O
so O
we B-PER:Group
purposely O
did O
n't O
watch O
the O
trial O
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
read O
about O
it O
on O
the O
internet O
. O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
he B-PER:Individual
-- O
killed O
his B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
when O
she B-PER:Individual
was O
-- O
eight O
months O
pregnant O
and O
-- O
and O
dumped O
her B-PER:Individual
in O
, O
uh O
-- O
the B-LOC:Water-Body
ocean I-LOC:Water-Body
, O
basically O
. O

So O
why O
was O
it O
so O
special O
? O

Why O
did O
that O
, O
uh O
-- O
particular O
case O
make O
-- O
the O
the O
national O
news O
? O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
because O
it O
was O
in O
such O
, O
it O
was O
like O
a O
, O
um O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
it O
was O
-- O
in O
such O
a O
quiet O
, O
upscale O
community O
where O
it O
happened O
and O
-- O
um O
just O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
the O
fact O
of O
her B-PER:Individual
being O
eight O
months O
pregnant O
, O
um O
, O
drew O
a O
lot O
of O
attention O
and O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
of O
course O
people B-PER:Group
were O
worried O
about O
her B-PER:Individual
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
then O
they B-PER:Group
found O
her B-PER:Individual
and O
blah O
blah O
blah O
. O

It O
was O
-- O
gossip O
, O
basically O
. O

Oh O
, O
but O
the B-PER:Individual
mistress I-PER:Individual
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
murder O
? O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
yeah O
, O
cause O
he B-PER:Individual
found O
out O
, O
they B-PER:Group
found O
out O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
a B-PER:Individual
mistress I-PER:Individual
, O
and O
then O
it O
was O
like O
, O
oh O
-- O
Yeah O
. O

Are O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
so O
, O
but O
who B-PER:Individual
knows O
? O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
very O
sad O
cause O
she B-PER:Individual
has O
a B-PER:Individual
child I-PER:Individual
herself B-PER:Individual
and O
so O
she B-PER:Individual
drug O
her B-PER:Individual
son I-PER:Individual
through O
a O
lot O
of O
-- O
uh O
, O
drama O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
need O
to O
be O
part O
of O
. O

She B-PER:Individual
has O
a B-PER:Individual
son I-PER:Individual
too O
, O
so O
he B-PER:Individual
he B-PER:Individual
also O
got O
put O
-- O
um O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
in O
the O
spotlight O
a O
bit O
, O
from O
what O
I B-PER:Individual
understand O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
have O
TV O
though O
, O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
really O
know O
. O

Oh O
, O
the B-PER:Individual
son I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
, O
right O
right O
. O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
of O
-- O
of O
his B-PER:Individual
girlfriend I-PER:Individual
, O
yeah O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
hear O
though O
, O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
going O
to O
be O
-- O
the B-PER:Individual
first I-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
to I-PER:Individual
be I-PER:Individual
( I-PER:Individual
( I-PER:Individual
) I-PER:Individual
) I-PER:Individual
um I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
uh I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
killed I-PER:Individual
for I-PER:Individual
a I-PER:Individual
crime I-PER:Individual
in I-PER:Individual
California I-PER:Individual
in I-PER:Individual
like I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
thirty I-PER:Individual
five I-PER:Individual
years I-PER:Individual
or I-PER:Individual
something I-PER:Individual
. O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they B-PER:Group
've O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they B-PER:Group
've O
-- O
um O
-- O
given O
him B-PER:Individual
the B-Sentence
death I-Sentence
penalty I-Sentence
yet O
. O

But O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
would O
be O
the B-PER:Individual
first I-PER:Individual
in I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
in I-PER:Individual
a I-PER:Individual
really I-PER:Individual
long I-PER:Individual
time I-PER:Individual
to I-PER:Individual
actually I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
be I-PER:Individual
killed I-PER:Individual
. O

Kelly B-PER:Individual
Um O
-- O
why O
, O
uh O
, O
now O
why O
did O
they B-PER:Group
decide O
that O
this O
was O
to O
be O
this O
big O
( O
( O
) O
) O
out O
of O
this O
with O
the O
most O
heinous O
crime O
in O
all O
of O
California B-GPE:State-or-Province
? O

Kelly B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
that O
's O
not O
how O
they B-PER:Group
decide O
who B-PER:Individual
died O
, O
but O
it O
's O
because O
of O
the O

Kelly B-PER:Individual
the O
, O
uh O
, O
cou O
-, O
like O
the O
-- O
the B-ORG:Government
court I-ORG:Government
that I-ORG:Government
they I-ORG:Government
went I-ORG:Government
to I-ORG:Government
, O
like O
the O
area O
does O
n't O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
well O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
why O
they B-PER:Group
decided O
on O
this O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
was O
because O
it O
was O
so O
public O
of O
a O
case O
. O

But O
they B-PER:Group
have O
a O
lot O
of O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
they B-PER:Group
have O
many O
many O
worse O
crimes O
going O
on O
in O
California B-GPE:State-or-Province
, O
parents B-PER:Group
killing O
their B-PER:Group
children I-PER:Group
and O
everything O
, O
that O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
would O
think O
-- O
would O
would O
, O
um O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
be O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
yeah O
, O
but O
they B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
, O
they B-PER:Group
ignore O
those O
because O
this O
one O
got O
on O
television O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
. O

Kelly B-PER:Individual
keep O
like O
-- O
uh O
, O
the B-PER:Group
jury I-PER:Group
from O
watching O
~ O
TV O
and O
the B-ORG:Media
media I-ORG:Media
and O
stuff O
. O

But O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
now O
( O
( O
it O
's O
, O
uh O
) O
) O
-- O
pretty O
much O
impossible O
-- O
to O
do O
. O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
i B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
never O
really O
got O
the O
whole O
-- O
watching O
it O
on O
~ O
TV O
and O
and O
getting O
into O
the O
whole O
-- O
mystery O
of O
it O
because O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
the B-PER:Individual
woman I-PER:Individual
's O
dead O
and O
so O
is O
her B-PER:Individual
child I-PER:Individual
and O
-- O
and O
-- O
there O
's O
-- O
really O
no O
way O
of O
changing O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
. O

Yeah O
, O
uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
strange O
how O
it O
was O
so O
publicized O
. O

Like O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
just O
, O
seriously O
, O
like O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
, O
like O
I B-PER:Individual
try O
not O
to O
watch O
, O
like O
-- O
too O
much O
, O
like O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
ca O
n't O
help O
it O
sometimes O
. O

But O
it O
just O
amazes O
me B-PER:Individual
that O
, O
uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
ridiculous O
how O
publicized O
-- O
how O
much O
publicity O
it O
got O
because O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
there O
's O
like O
human B-PER:Group
rights O
violations O
going O
on O
all O
around O
the B-LOC:Celestial
world I-LOC:Celestial
. O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
there O
's O
like O
, O
genocide O
in O
Sudan B-GPE:Nation
right O
now O
but O
like O
, O
nobody B-PER:Individual
talks O
about O
that O
. O

Oh O
yeah O
and O
what O
's O
going O
on O
in O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
know O
and O
people B-PER:Group
-- O
flock O
, O
flock O
to O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
store I-FAC:Building-Grounds
to O
buy O
all O
their B-PER:Group
-- O
all O
their B-PER:Group
foreign O
made O
goods O
and O
it O
's O
like O
what O
are O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
-- O
doing O
? O

Obviously O
they B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
really O
care O
about O
what O
's O
going O
on O
. O

They B-PER:Group
just O
like O
to O
hear O
the O
details O
. O

Maybe O
if O
they B-PER:Group
could O
hear O
the O
details O
about O
other O
things O
they B-PER:Group
would O
be O
more O
involved O
. O

Um O
( O
( O
) O
) O
it O
's O
almost O
like O
, O
uh O
-- O
( O
( O
) O
) O
diversion O
but O
it O
just O
seems O
like O
they B-PER:Group
just O
make O
it O
into O
like O
, O
like O
a O
soap O
opera O
for O
people B-PER:Group
to O
watch O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
? O

Well O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
some B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
were O
glued O
to O
their B-PER:Group
~ O
TVs O
for O
weeks O
, O
and O
it O
's O
just O
to O
disturbing O
that O
that O
would O
be O
their B-PER:Group
-- O
their B-PER:Group
main O
entertainment O
during O
the O
day O
. O

Hillary B-PER:Individual
Especially O
when O
there O
's O
so O
many O
other O
things O
they B-PER:Group
could O
be O
doing O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
could O
not O
sit O
around O
all O
day O
and O
watch O
a O
murder O
trial O
on O
~ O
TV O
, O
especially O
with O
my B-PER:Group
kids I-PER:Group
around O
. O

uh O
, O
the B-PER:Individual

at O

, O
um O
, O
it O

I B-PER:Individual

always O
ready O
to O
bite O
anyone B-PER:Individual

head O
off O
that O
ha O
- O
had O
anything O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate

, O
slightly O
wrong O
abo O
- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
uh O
, O
ow O
, O
or O
amiss O
about O
Amber B-PER:Individual
. O

Well O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
you B-PER:Individual
may O
think O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
a O
little O
-- O
crazy O
, O
but O
at O
first O
when O
I B-PER:Individual
heard O
about O
, O
uh O
, O
Frey B-PER:Individual
, O
when O
I B-PER:Individual
first O
heard O
about O
her B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
got O
worried O
that O
maybe O
it O
was O
-- O
both B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
them I-PER:Group

B B-PER:Individual
because O
they B-PER:Group
're O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
never O
totally O
-- O
believed O
-- O
that O
Peterson B-PER:Individual
did O
this O
all O
by O
himself B-PER:Individual
. O

She B-PER:Individual
may O
have O
-- O
she B-PER:Individual
may O
have O
, O
uh O
, O
planted O
the O
idea O
in O
his B-PER:Individual
head O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
. O

Yet O
something O
tells O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
and O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
actually O
-- O
was O
so O
involved O
her B-PER:Individual
, O
th O
- O
Amber B-PER:Individual
, O

B B-PER:Individual
that O
if O
-- O
she B-PER:Individual
had O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
this O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
he B-PER:Individual
would O
ever O
tell O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
believe O
he B-PER:Individual
would O
ever O
tell O
on O
her B-PER:Individual
. O

There O
was O
the O
impression O
I B-PER:Individual
got O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
kind O
of O
, O
uh O
, O
watched O
him B-PER:Individual
at O
different O
times O
when O
they B-PER:Group
would O
mention O
her B-PER:Individual

A B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
he B-PER:Individual
seemed O
to O
be O
be O
very O
vili O
- O
he B-PER:Individual
seemed O
to O
be O
most O
most O
un O
- O
at O
- O
eh O
, O
un O
- O
at O
- O
ease O

B B-PER:Individual
and O
I B-PER:Individual
just O
think O
that O

A B-PER:Individual
when O
they B-PER:Group
were O
talking O
about O
Amber B-PER:Individual
. O

And O
that O
caught O
my B-PER:Individual
eye O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
because O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
a B-PER:Individual
woman I-PER:Individual
but O
, O
um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
thought O
, O
uh O
- O
oh O
, O

B B-PER:Individual
because O
at O
that O
time O
, O
uh O
-- O
right O
now O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
been O
, O
like O
, O
totally O
busy O
with O
, O
uh O
, O
holiday O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
so O

their I-Crime
unborn I-Crime
son I-Crime
, O
and O
he B-PER:Individual
now O
faces O
the B-Sentence
death I-Sentence
penalty I-Sentence
. O

Do O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
think O
he B-PER:Individual
is O
guilty O
of O
the O
crimes O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
been O
convicted O
of O
? O

If O
so O
, O
what O
were O
his B-PER:Individual
motives O
? O

How O
closely O
did O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
follow O
the O
trial O
and O
what O
do O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
think O
of O
all O
of O
the O
media B-ORG:Media
coverage O
of O
the O
trial O
? O

What O
kind O
of O
sentencing O
should O
Peterson B-PER:Individual
receive O
? O

My B-PER:Individual
name O
is O
Jean O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
in O
Arizona B-GPE:State-or-Province
. O

Mohammed B-PER:Individual

, O
from O
Arizona B-GPE:State-or-Province
, O
Jean B-PER:Individual
. O

Jean B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
fine O
, O
thank O
you B-PER:Individual
. O

Mohammed B-PER:Individual
Ah O
, O
this B-PER:Individual
is O
Mohammed B-PER:Individual
, O
calling O
from O
New B-GPE:Population-Center
York I-GPE:Population-Center
. O

Jean B-PER:Individual
Mohammed B-PER:Individual
, O
calling O
from O
New B-GPE:Population-Center
York I-GPE:Population-Center
. O

Well O
, O
the O
topic O
is O
interesting O
, O
but O
they B-PER:Group
've O
been O
having O
this O
one O
for O
three O
days O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
why O
they B-PER:Group
're O
so O
obsessed O
with O
it O
. O

Mohammed B-PER:Individual
Seems O
like O
it O
's O
a O
weekend O
, O
or O
they B-PER:Group
want O
to O
get O
as O
much O
as O
they B-PER:Group
can O
feedback O
from O
people B-PER:Group
. O

Jean B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
so O
, O
Yes O
. O

And O
so O
what O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
was O
- O

Jean B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
actually O
-- O
watch O
the O
trial O
very O
much O
, O
uh O
th O
- O
in O
fact O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
watch O
the O
trial O
at O
all O
. O

Jean B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
read O
about O
it O
in O
the O
newspaper O
and O
things O
like O
that O
. O

Um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
think O
from O
all O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
things O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
have O
heard O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
-- O
had O
to O
be O
guilty O
with O
all O
the O
evidence O
that O
they B-PER:Group
had O
, O
but O
um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
really O
know O
why O
, O
uh O
, O
if O
everybody B-PER:Group
was O
so O
, O
sort O
of O
, O
obsessed O
about O
it O
when O
we B-PER:Group
've O
got O
so O
much O
other O
-- O
things O
going O
on O
in O
the B-LOC:Celestial
world I-LOC:Celestial
that O
, O
uh O
, O
seem O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
much O
more O
important O
, O
but O
um O
. O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
because O
he B-PER:Individual
seemed O
, O
uh O
, O
a B-PER:Individual
very I-PER:Individual
human I-PER:Individual
kind I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
and O
, O
and O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
cou O
- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
could O
n't O
really O
understand O
why O
he B-PER:Individual
would O
want O
to O
do O
something O
about O
that O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
his B-PER:Individual
motive O
must O
have O
been O
to O
be O
with O
his B-PER:Individual
new I-PER:Individual
girlfriend I-PER:Individual
, O
but O
uh O
- O
-- O
kill O
his B-PER:Individual
own I-PER:Individual
first I-PER:Individual
child I-PER:Individual
that O
way O
is O
extraordinary O
. O

What O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
about O
it O
? O

Being O
very O
frankly O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
not O
, O
uh O
, O
following O
the O
case O
at O
all O
even O
uh O
uh O
television O
, O
or O
uh O
reading O
, O
but O
from O
what O
I B-PER:Individual
can O
observe O
, O
that O
it O
seems O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
has O
been O
talking O
-- O
-- O
taking O
too O
long O
time O
. O

Like O
one O
year O
almost O
, O
now O
. O

It O
was O
-- O
taking O
so O
much O
time O
. O

The O
case O
is O
almost O
one O
year O
. O

Like O
last O
, O
uh O
, O
Christmas O
if O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
, O
uh O
, O
recalling O
my B-PER:Individual
memory O
. O

So O
for O
one O
year O
, O
it O
's O
really O
a O
good O
time O
. O

So O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
asking O
myself B-PER:Individual
why O
it O
took O
such O
a O
long O

It O
may O
be O
because O
-- O
it O
's O
quite O
important O
, O
or O
so O
there O
is O
so O
many O
everything O
's O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
it O
's O
, O
it O
's O
a O
really O
different O
case O
. O

But O
, O
the O
quo O
- O
the O
nice O
quotient O
is O
about O
the B-ORG:Media
media I-ORG:Media
. O

But O
the B-ORG:Media
media I-ORG:Media
have O
biased O
in O
this O
, O

I B-PER:Individual
believe O
that O
media B-ORG:Media
is O
a O
very O
good O
, O
uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
way O
to O
give O
us B-PER:Group
all O
the O
opportunity O
to O
understand O
and O
see O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
without O
the B-ORG:Media
media I-ORG:Media
, O
you B-PER:Individual
and O
I B-PER:Individual
, O
how O
we B-PER:Group
will O
be O
knowing O
? O

Do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
they B-ORG:Media
were O
biased O
in O
in O
-- O
favor O
of O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
or O
in O
favor O

No O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

No O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
think O
so O
either O
from O
what O
I B-PER:Individual
heard O
. O

Mohammed B-PER:Individual
Maybe O
-- O
sometimes O
in O
- O
in O
- O
in O
- O
in O
other O
issues O
they B-ORG:Media
- O
they B-ORG:Media
may O
be O
biased O
, O
but O
in O
this O
issue O
they B-ORG:Media
were O
just O
-- O
covering O
what O
's O
happening O
, O

Mohammed B-PER:Individual
and O
, O
uh O
, O
they B-ORG:Media
give O
us B-PER:Group
the O
picture O
. O

It O
was O
a O
camera O
-- O
to O
give O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
the O
view O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
they B-ORG:Media
were O
biased O
in O
this O
case O
here O
. O

And O
, O
uh O
, O
what O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
will O
happen O
next O
? O

Well O
, O
uh O
they B-PER:Group
're O
coming O
up O
to O
the O
sentencing O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
heard O
yesterday O
or O
read O
in O
the O
newspaper O
or O
something O
that O
his B-PER:Individual
brother I-PER:Individual
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
it O
was O
on O
the O
television O
. O

In O
the O
news O
, O
his B-PER:Individual
brother I-PER:Individual
was O
appealing O
-- O
for O
them B-PER:Group
to O
to O
sentence O
him B-PER:Individual
to O
-- O
to O
prison B-Sentence
for I-Sentence
life I-Sentence
rather O
than O
the O
death O
penalty O
, O
because O
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
said O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
a B-PER:Individual
very I-PER:Individual
good I-PER:Individual
listener I-PER:Individual
and O
he B-PER:Individual
cares O
about O
people B-PER:Group
, O
and O
and O
he B-PER:Individual
might O
be O
able O
to O
help O
a B-PER:Group
lot I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
prison I-PER:Group
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
that O
is O
true O
or O
not O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
know O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
done O
a O
lot O
of O
volunteer O
things O
before O
, O
and O
that O
was O
the O
one O
things O
that O
made O
me B-PER:Individual
wonder O
there O
was O
any O
possible O
chance O
that O
it O
could O
have O
been O
somebody B-PER:Individual
else I-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
did I-PER:Individual
it I-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
given O
such O
as O
I B-PER:Individual
have O
heard O
, O
even O
though O
like O
you B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
did O
not O
follow O
the O
case O
day O
by O
day O
or O
anything O
like O
that O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
quite O
see O
how O
he B-PER:Individual
could O
not O
be O
guilty O
if O
they B-PER:Group
've O
got O
so O
much O
that O
appears O
to O
point O
to O
him B-PER:Individual
. O

And O
what O
would O
be O
the O
motive O
for O
anybody B-PER:Individual
trying O
to O
-- O
to O
get O
him B-PER:Individual
if O
it O
was O
n't O

Arafat I-PER:Individual

in O
a B-FAC:Building-Grounds
Paris I-FAC:Building-Grounds
hospital I-FAC:Building-Grounds
last O

's O
death O
will O
help O
or O
hurt O
the O
Israeli- B-GPE:Nation
Palestinian B-GPE:Special
peace O
process O
? O

Was O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
a B-PER:Individual
good I-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
? O

What O
do O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
think O
US B-GPE:Nation
policy O
should O
be O
toward O
Palestine B-GPE:Special
now O
that O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
has O
died O
? O

What O
, O
if O
anything O
, O
should O
the B-GPE:Nation
US I-GPE:Nation
do O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
Middle B-GPE:GPE-Cluster

Marco B-PER:Individual
Hi O
. O
Wha O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
catch O
your B-PER:Individual
name O
. O

Gandhi B-PER:Individual
Gandhi B-PER:Individual
from O
New B-GPE:Population-Center
York I-GPE:Population-Center
. O

Uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
fresh O
topic O
for O
tonight O
. O

So O
what O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
? O

Well O
, O
um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
would O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
would O
have O
to O
start O
- O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
would O
have O
to O
start O
, O
generally O
, O
in O
stating O
- O
-- O
stating O
what O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
is O
the O
problem O
and O
-- O
- O
with O
the B-GPE:GPE-Cluster
Middle I-GPE:GPE-Cluster
East I-GPE:GPE-Cluster
and O
what O
- O
For O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
one O
of O
the O
major O
problems O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
-- O
the B-GPE:Nation
-- I-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
government I-GPE:Nation
gives O
so O
much O
aid O
to O
the B-GPE:Nation
state I-GPE:Nation
of I-GPE:Nation
Israel I-GPE:Nation
. O

In O
which O
, O
the B-GPE:Nation
state I-GPE:Nation
of I-GPE:Nation
Israel I-GPE:Nation
buys O
-- O
many B-WEA:Underspecified
expensive I-WEA:Underspecified
military I-WEA:Underspecified
weapons I-WEA:Underspecified
, O
ah O
, O
which B-WEA:Underspecified
is O
used O
to O
-- O
oppress O
and O
-- O
to O
kill O
a B-PER:Group
lot I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
Palestinians I-PER:Group
. O

So O
, O
for O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
that O
's O
-- O
the O
- O
that O
's O
essentially O
the O
root O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

And O
, O
um O
, O
Yasser B-PER:Individual
Arafat I-PER:Individual
was O
kind O
of O
in O
a O
difficult O
position O
, O
because O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
have O
these B-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
um I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
incredibly I-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
oppressed I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
some I-PER:Group
ways I-PER:Group
imprisoned I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
uh I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
Palestinians I-PER:Group
, O
and O
if O
-- O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
had O
n't O
, O
um O
, O
tried O
to O
stand O
up O
-- O
and O
help O
them B-PER:Group
and O
- O
and O
fight O
for O
their B-PER:Group
rights O
, O
then O
-- O
m O
- O
they B-PER:Group
would O
n't O
have O
respected O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
, O
but O
then O
again O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
could O
n't O
be O
too O
friendly O
with O
the B-GPE:GPE-Cluster
West I-GPE:GPE-Cluster
, O
um O
, O
and O
, O
um O
, O
and O
so O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
the O
best O
he B-PER:Individual
could O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
. O

It O
's O
a O
difficult O
-- O
leadership O
role O
. O

Um O
, O
what O
do O
- O
Well O
, O
how O
about O
you B-PER:Individual
? O

Gandhi B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
, O
yeah O
, O
more O
or O
less O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
c O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
agree O
with O
what O
you B-PER:Individual
said O
. O

It O
's O
almost O
, O
this O
is O
my B-PER:Individual
view O
as O
well O
. O

And O
the O
question O
is O
, O
what O
next O
? O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
some O
idea O
-- O
from O
Israeli B-GPE:Nation
side I-GPE:Nation
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
were O
saying O
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
a O
problem O
, O
and O
if O
he B-PER:Individual
goes O
, O
everything O
will O
be O
quite O
easy O
. O

Now O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
not O
in O
anymore O
. O

So O
, O
let O
us B-PER:Indeterminate
wait O
and O
see O
. O

If O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
a O
problem O
himself B-PER:Individual
, O
hope O
- O
uh O
, O
the B-PER:Individual
coming I-PER:Individual
one I-PER:Individual
-- O
will O
be O
in O
a O
good O
-- O
position O
to O
negotiate O
with O
the B-GPE:Nation
other I-GPE:Nation
side I-GPE:Nation
, O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
, O
and O
then O
-- O
peace O
can O
be O
achieved O
. O

Uh O
, O
we B-PER:Indeterminate
have O
to O
wait O
and O
see O
, O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
seems O
it O
's O
not O
easy O
. O

Marco B-PER:Individual
But O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
, O
eh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
- O
-- O

We B-PER:Indeterminate
ca O
n't O
put O
it O
on O
-- O
the O
ro O
- O
or O
the O
- O
-- O
the O
whole O
responsibility O
of O
the O
pre O
- O
-- O
peace O
process O
ca O
n't O
be O
the B-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
a I-PER:Individual
- I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
a I-PER:Individual
group I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
is I-PER:Individual
- I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
I I-PER:Individual
do I-PER:Individual
n't I-PER:Individual
know I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
in I-PER:Individual
my I-PER:Individual
view I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
has I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
not I-PER:Individual
ver I-PER:Individual
- I-PER:Individual
not I-PER:Individual
very I-PER:Individual
many I-PER:Individual
resources I-PER:Individual
to I-PER:Individual
fight I-PER:Individual
- I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
to I-PER:Individual
fight I-PER:Individual
this I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
battle I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
their I-PER:Individual
trying I-PER:Individual
to I-PER:Individual
fight I-PER:Individual
against I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
a I-PER:Individual
government I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
has I-PER:Individual
taken I-PER:Individual
away I-PER:Individual
a I-PER:Individual
lot I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
their I-PER:Individual
land I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
you I-PER:Individual
know I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
does I-PER:Individual
n't I-PER:Individual
allow I-PER:Individual
them I-PER:Individual
to I-PER:Individual
really I-PER:Individual
move I-PER:Individual
around I-PER:Individual
in I-PER:Individual
their I-PER:Individual
own I-PER:Individual
country I-PER:Individual
. O

So O
, O
unless O
that O
-- O
stops O
, O
the O
, O
um O
, O
the B-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
Palestinians I-PER:Individual
-- O
really O
ca O
n't O
do O
too O
much O
-- O
to O
further O
the O
peace O
process O
, O
because O
-- O
there O
are O
-- O
a O
lot O
of O
bad O
things O
happening O
to O
the B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
that I-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
leader I-PER:Group
. O

Marco B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
so O
it O
's O
- O
-- O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
, O
it O
's O
- O
-- O
it O
seems O
like O
the O
, O
um O
, O
the B-ORG:Media
media I-ORG:Media
, O
at O
least O
in O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
, O
is O
-- O
putting O
all O
of O
this O
-- O
focus O
and O
responsibility O
on O
the B-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
Palestinians I-PER:Individual
, O
as O
if O
it O
was O

Marco B-PER:Individual
Arafat B-PER:Individual
's O
fault O
that O
any O
of O
- O
-- O
any O
of O
the O
violence O
was O
caused O
. O

So O
, O
it O
seems O
like O
an O
unfair O
treatment O
-- O
of O
- O
-- O
of O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
the B-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
Palestinian I-PER:Individual
people I-PER:Individual
. O

Actually O
, O
it O
- O
it O
's O
a O
good O
topic O
to O
be O
choosing O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
because O
it O
's O
one O
of O
the O
fresh O
topics O
. O

How O
long O
have O
you B-PER:Individual
been O
with O
the O
study O
? O

Uh O
, O
this O
is O
probably O
my B-PER:Individual
tenth O
or O
eleventh O
conversation O
. O

Almost O
the O
same O
like O
me B-PER:Individual
. O

So O
, O
the O
other O
-- O
days O
, O
which O
one O
was O
quite O
interesting O
to O
you B-PER:Individual
? O

Um O
, O
well O
, O
there O
's O
been O
a O
couple O
where O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
've O
- O
they B-PER:Group
talked O
about O
the B-PER:Group
Cabinet I-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
for I-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
Bush I-PER:Group
, O
and O
Bush B-PER:Individual
has O
been O
, O
um O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
selecting O
new B-PER:Group
Cabinet I-PER:Group
members I-PER:Group
and O
-- O
all B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
new I-PER:Group
members I-PER:Group
are O
people B-PER:Group
that I-PER:Group
I I-PER:Group
'm I-PER:Group
- I-PER:Group
I I-PER:Group
do I-PER:Group
n't I-PER:Group
really I-PER:Group
know I-PER:Group
very I-PER:Group
well I-PER:Group
. O

So O
, O
there O
's O
been O
some O
topics O
where O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
have O
very O
much O
information O
. O

Other O
topics O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
usually O
about O
the O
election O
that O
- O
-- O
that O
, O
um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
did O
have O
-- O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
, O
um O
, O
to O
say O
. O

Are O
you B-PER:Individual
- O
are O
you B-PER:Individual
, O
um O
, O
are O
you B-PER:Individual
from O
the B-GPE:Nation

, O
he B-PER:Individual
just O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
honor O
a B-PER:Individual
terrorist I-PER:Individual
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
one O
of O
the O
few O
things O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
happy O
about O
with O
Giuliani B-PER:Individual
when O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
mayor B-PER:Individual
. O

Uh O
, O
Giuliani B-PER:Individual
got O
very O
popular O
later O
because O
of O
the O
- O
the O

Ben B-PER:Individual
World B-FAC:Building-Grounds
Trade I-FAC:Building-Grounds
Center I-FAC:Building-Grounds
thing O
but O
he B-PER:Individual
- O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
so O
popular O
as O
a B-PER:Individual
mayor I-PER:Individual
. O

Ben B-PER:Individual
But O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
- O
I B-PER:Individual
kind O
of O
agreed O
with O
that O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
thing O
, O
though O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
-- O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
think O
he B-PER:Individual
accomplished O
something O
in O
that O
the B-PER:Group
Palestinian I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
do O
have O
a O
legitimate O
grievance O
and O
he B-PER:Individual
put O
it O
on O
the O
map O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
. O

Sue B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
- O
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
really O
failed O
miserably O
, O
in O
my B-PER:Individual
opinion O
, O
when O
he B-PER:Individual
, O
um O
, O
refused O
to O
sign O
that O
treaty O
that O
was O
originally O
set O
up O
because O
it O
was O
a O
wonderful O
-- O
option O
and O
it O
really O
could O
've O
re O
- O
done O
some O
wonderful O
things O
for O
his B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
and O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
really O
did O
them B-PER:Group
a O
disservice O
by O
not O
taking O
care O
of O
it O
at O
that O
time O
. O

Yeah O
, O
what O
was O
the O
treaty O
? O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
familiar O
with O
it O
. O

Sue B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
um O
, O
where O
they B-GPE:Nation
were O
going O
to O
, O
uh O
, O
give O
them B-GPE:Special
, O
like O
, O
ninety B-LOC:Region-General
- I-LOC:Region-General
six I-LOC:Region-General
percent I-LOC:Region-General
of I-LOC:Region-General
the I-LOC:Region-General
Ga I-LOC:Region-General
- I-LOC:Region-General
of I-LOC:Region-General
- I-LOC:Region-General
of I-LOC:Region-General
Gaza I-LOC:Region-General
and O
he B-PER:Individual
said O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
wanted O
all B-LOC:Region-General
hundred I-LOC:Region-General
percent I-LOC:Region-General
. O

And O
so O
he B-PER:Individual
refused O
to O
sign O
it O
. O

It O
was O
just O
an O
- O
an O
incredible O
faux O
pas O
on O
his B-PER:Individual
part O
, O
from O
my B-PER:Individual
opinion O
. O

Yeah O
, O
y O
- O
it O
's O
- O
it O
's O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
have O
to O
sometimes O
take O
a O
little O
bit O
less O
than O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
want O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
uh O
, O
an O
- O
and O
ninety B-Numeric:Percent
- I-Numeric:Percent
six I-Numeric:Percent
percent I-Numeric:Percent
is O
a O
big O
percentage O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
could O
have O
really O
done O
some O
wonderful O
uh O
steps O
for O
-- O
uh O
for O
the B-PER:Group
Palestinian I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
uh O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
felt O
-- O
very O
sad O
that O
, O
um O
, O
that O
that O
was O
n't O
-- O
done O
. O

Um O
, O
it O
was O
really O
quite O
unfortunate O
that O
- O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
-- O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
not O
willing O
to O
, O
um O
, O
step O
forward O
-- O
to O
do O
- O
do O
what O
was O
really O
in O
the O
best O
interests O
of O
his B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
. O

Ben B-PER:Individual
Sometimes O
- O
sometimes O
I B-PER:Individual
th O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
hard O
when O
- O
when O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
're O
the O
- O
the B-PER:Individual
first I-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
, O
or O
the B-PER:Individual
George I-PER:Individual
Washington I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
something I-PER:Individual
, O
to O
see O
things O
other O
than O
in O
black O
and O
white O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
or O
maybe O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
have O
the O
gift O
of O
- O
of O
nuance O
that O
would O
've O
helped O
him B-PER:Individual
to O
- O
-- O
to O
take O
that O
right O
step O
, O
uh O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
the O
- O
-- O
the O
-- O
his B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
suffer O
so O
terribly O
and O
maybe O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
it O
could O
have O
been O
better O
if O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
signed O
that O
, O
huh O
. O

Sue B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
really O
think O
so O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
really O
, O
truly O
do O
and O
now O
it O
's O
a O
- O
a O
situation O
where O
, O
with O
his B-PER:Individual
passing O
, O
um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
there O
's O
a O
real O
, O
um O
, O
new O
opening O
, O
a O
new O
possibility O
for O
- O
-- O
some O
extremely O
positive O
steps O
to O
come O
forward O
out O
of O
this O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
think O
that O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
-- O
will O
probably O
be O
requested O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
negotiation O
process O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
understand O
that O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
me B-PER:Individual
- O
uh O
, O
because O
, O
um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
both B-GPE:Nation
sides I-GPE:Nation
-- O
have O
a O
trust O
in O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
that O
make O
it O
- O

And O
we B-GPE:Nation
've O
ha O
- O
we B-GPE:Nation
have O
a O
history O
, O
uh O
, O
Clinton B-PER:Individual
and O
Carter B-PER:Individual
w O
- O
worked O
over B-LOC:Region-International
there I-LOC:Region-International
-- O
- O
try O
to O
get O
some O
peace O
going O
. O

They B-PER:Group
they B-PER:Group
they B-PER:Group
worked O
very O
personally O
. O

They B-PER:Group
had O
those O
retreats O
and O
things O
with O
the B-PER:Group
leaders I-PER:Group
, O

And O
stuff O
, O
and O
uh O
-- O
That O
's O
why O
we B-GPE:Nation
should O
be O
there B-GPE:Nation
but O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
kind O
of O
scared O
of O
the B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
-- O
that B-PER:Group
represent O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
now O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
. O

They B-PER:Group
're O
not O
quite O
the O
same O
caliber O
. O

Sue B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
that O
's O
really O
true O
, O
um O
, O
but O
it O
- O
it O
is O
a O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
we B-GPE:Nation
are O
having O
a O
- O
a O
-- O
step O
forward O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
ways O
, O
um O
. O

We B-GPE:Nation
- O
we B-GPE:Nation
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
, O
do O
have O
some O
potentials O
, O
um O
, O
to O
do O
some O
extremely O
positive O
, O
um O
, O
um O
, O
things O
. O

's O
an O
interesting O
question O
they B-PER:Group
're O
asking O
. O

Paul B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
it O
is O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
past O
couple O
of O
topics O
have O
been O
-- O
more O
controversial O
than O
-- O
the O
early O
topics O
-- O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
well O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
very O
opinionated O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
happy O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
. O

Rainia B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
go O
right O
ahead O
. O

Paul B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
um O
, O
Yasser B-PER:Individual
Arafat I-PER:Individual
was O
-- O
was O
he B-PER:Individual
a B-PER:Individual
good I-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
? O

I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
-- O
pretty O
much O
-- O
-- O
or O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
pretty O
much O
-- O
following O
what O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
always O
done O
, O
even O
as O
a B-PER:Individual
young I-PER:Individual
man I-PER:Individual
, O
uh O
, O
back O
in O
Algeria B-GPE:Nation
-- O
when O
- O
when O
he B-PER:Individual
led O
the O
-- O
terrorist O
attacks O
against O
the B-PER:Group
French I-PER:Group
to O
kick O
them B-PER:Group
out O
of O
-- O
Algeria B-GPE:Nation
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
there B-GPE:Special
in I-GPE:Special
Palestine I-GPE:Special
. O

I B-PER:Individual
- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
, O
eh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
he B-PER:Individual
really O
knew O
how O
to O
, O
uh O
, O
take O
on O
the O
role O
of O
- O
of O
peacemaker B-PER:Individual
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
could O
be O
wrong O
. O

But O
i O
- O
it O
seems O
like O
that O
- O
that O
was O
always O
a O
problem O
for O
him B-PER:Individual
. O

Um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
sure O
myself B-PER:Individual
uh O
how O
good O
a B-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
he B-PER:Individual
was O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
get O
the O
truth O
w O
- O
when O
the O
-- O
when O
the O
there O
's O
so O
many O
uh O
slanted O
uh O
-- O
information O

Rainia B-PER:Individual
especially O
on O
the B-ORG:Media
main I-ORG:Media
media I-ORG:Media
. O

Rainia B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
-- O
like O
the O
way O
-- O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
has O
been O
-- O
going O
after O
the B-GPE:Special
Palestinians I-GPE:Special

I B-PER:Individual
think O
Ariel B-PER:Individual
Sharon I-PER:Individual
is O
a O
lot O
like O
Yasser B-PER:Individual
Arafat I-PER:Individual
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
ca O
n't O
understand O
why O
the B-PER:Group
two I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
them I-PER:Group
-- O
did O
n't O
see O
the O
similarities O
. O

Um O
, O
and O
they B-PER:Group
were O
asking O
-- O
too O
, O
of O
-- O
about O
the O
, O
should O
the B-GPE:Nation
~ I-GPE:Nation
US I-GPE:Nation
be O
involved O
-- O
in O
that O
whole O
thing O
? O

That O
- O
that O
's O
interesting O
, O
too O
, O
because O
-- O
cutting O
Yasser B-PER:Individual
Arafat I-PER:Individual
out O
of O
the O
whole O
thing O
was O
- O
-- O
was O
really O
-- O
George B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
's O
decision O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
personally O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
like O
him B-PER:Individual
because O
he B-PER:Individual
thought O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
a O
- O
-- O
a B-PER:Individual
liar I-PER:Individual
-- O
so O
he B-PER:Individual
refused O
to O
-- O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
him B-PER:Individual
. O

Rainia B-PER:Individual
Uh O
, O
which O
- O
which B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
are O
you B-PER:Individual
talking O
about O
? O

Paul B-PER:Individual
Ev O
- O
everything O
kind O
of O
stopped O
when O
- O
-- O
when O
he B-PER:Individual
became O
president B-Job-Title
and O
all O
, O
uh O
, O
activity O
regarding O
-- O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
, O
Palestine B-GPE:Special
stopped O
. O

And O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
pretty O
much O
could O
do O
what O
they B-GPE:Nation
wanted O
. O

An O
- O
and O
you B-PER:Individual
're O
right O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
seem O
fair O
at O
all O
. O

Rainia B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
there O
're O
-- O
th O
- O
well O
, O
the O
way O
I B-PER:Individual
see O
it O
, O
eh O
, O
Bush B-PER:Individual
, O
eh O
, O
has O
a O
right B-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
wing I-PER:Group
Christian I-PER:Group
, O
right O
- O
wing O
agenda O
. O

He B-PER:Individual
he B-PER:Individual
's O
-- O
some O
-- O
how O
thinks O
that O
-- O
if O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
has O
-- O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
sure O
that O
all O
-- O
their B-PER:Group
prophecies O
are O
-- O
but O
there O
's O
something O
about O
-- O
if O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
can O
-- O
get O
rid O
of O
the B-GPE:Special
Palestinians I-GPE:Special
, O
that O
will O
somehow O
, O
um O
, O
their B-PER:Group
prophecy O
-- O
coming O
true O
and O
th O
- O
and O
then O
-- O
somehow O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
- O
we B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
-- O
understand O
what O
on O
Earth B-LOC:Celestial
they B-PER:Group
're O

Rainia B-PER:Individual
trying O
to O
achieve O
with O
this O
but O
i O
- O
it O
seems O
like O
a O
- O

Paul B-PER:Individual
that O
sounds O
kind O
of O
scary O
. O

Rainia B-PER:Individual
a O
Christian B-PER:Group
agenda O
, O
yeah O
, O
that O
that O
-- O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
end O
of O
the O
world O
, O
the O
end O
times O

if O
, O
um O
, O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
takes O
over O

Palestine B-GPE:Special
that O
's O
h O
- O
some O
-- O
has O
something O
to O
do O
with O
the O
end O
times O
. O

It O
's O
really O
-- O
frightening O
the O
way O
they B-PER:Group
talk O
-- O
and O
, O
um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
qualified O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
this O
at O
all O
. O

It O
never O
was O
right O
to O
begin O
with O
n O
- O
and O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
we B-GPE:Nation
- O
we B-GPE:Nation
're O
- O
we B-GPE:Nation
're O
only O
given O
certain O
information O
and O

Rainia B-PER:Individual
hard O
to O
really O
know O
the O
whole O

real O
story O
of O
what O

going O
on O
over B-GPE:GPE-Cluster
there I-GPE:GPE-Cluster
. O

Rainia B-PER:Individual
that O
what O
the B-GPE:Nation
Israelis I-GPE:Nation
are O
doing O
is O
wrong O
. O

By O

into O
their B-GPE:Special

and O
building O
these O

, O
what O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
about O
-- O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
? O

Uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
, O
um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
bet O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
a B-PER:Individual
really I-PER:Individual
good I-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
, O
um O
, O
that O
his B-PER:Individual
situation O
-- O
-- O
well O
, O
see O
I B-PER:Individual
got O
to O
the O
-- O
to O
- O
to O
the O
level O
of O
power O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
in O
-- O
back O
in O
the O
eighties O
-- O
and O
once O
he B-PER:Individual
, O
um O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
started O
getting O
wealthy O
and O
started O
getting O
known O
, O
that O
his B-PER:Individual
agenda O
ch O
- O
uh O
, O
changed O

Roger B-PER:Individual
but O
it O
was O
n't O
actually O
for O
peace O
but O
was O
to O
try O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
( O
( O
send O
) O
) O
the B-PER:Group
Israelis I-PER:Group
out O
of O
Jerusalem B-GPE:Population-Center
in O
the B-LOC:Region-General
areas I-LOC:Region-General
that I-LOC:Region-General
they I-LOC:Region-General
wanted I-LOC:Region-General
. O

I B-PER:Individual
really O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
-- O
they B-GPE:Special
wanted O
to O
coexist O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
, O
um O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
wanted O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
all B-PER:Group
his I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
-- O
all B-PER:Group
his I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
wanted O
to O
coexist O
with O
the B-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
Israelis I-PER:Group
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
, O
um O
, O
his B-PER:Individual
death O
-- O
marks O
a O
beginning O
of O
trying O
to O
find O
somebody B-PER:Individual
that B-PER:Individual
-- O
really O
wants O
peace O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
that O
in O
that B-LOC:Region-International
area I-LOC:Region-International
of I-LOC:Region-International
the I-LOC:Region-International
, I-LOC:Region-International
um I-LOC:Region-International
, I-LOC:Region-International
world I-LOC:Region-International
that O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
could O
actually O
have O
peace O
. O

If O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
the O
Bible O
well O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
would O
know O
that O
there O
's O
always O
going O
to O
be O
a O
conflict O
there B-LOC:Region-International
. O

Um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
should O
open O
up O
-- O
their B-GPE:Nation
-- O
doors O
to O
-- O
not O
help O
, O
but O
support O
any O
, O
um O
, O
process O
for O
peace O
in O
the B-LOC:Region-International
area I-LOC:Region-International
, O
though O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
that O
we B-GPE:Nation
should O
get O
involved O
to O
a O
level O
, O
a O
point O
where O
we B-GPE:Nation
're O
sending O
people B-PER:Group
over O
there B-LOC:Region-International
and O
, O
um O
, O
trying O
to O
-- O
help O
keep O
the O
peace O
or O
anything O
like O
that O
, O
um O
. O

There O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
stuff O
that O
can O
be O
done O
-- O
by O
just O
verbal O
suppo O
- O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
now O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
gone O
, O
his B-PER:Group
family I-PER:Group
is O
still O
around O
, O
and O

Roger B-PER:Individual
uh O
, O
millions B-Numeric:Money
and I-Numeric:Money
millions I-Numeric:Money
of I-Numeric:Money
dollars I-Numeric:Money
that O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
is O
still O
around O
but O
they B-PER:Group
-- O
if O
they B-PER:Group
bring O
people B-PER:Group
in O
that B-PER:Group
was O
n't O
involved O
with O
his B-PER:Group
cabinet I-PER:Group
, O
n O
- O
um O
, O
have O
different O
views O
than O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
somebody B-PER:Indeterminate
that B-PER:Indeterminate
gener O
- O
genuinely O
can O
accept O
the O
fact O
that O
the B-PER:Group
Israel I-PER:Group
- I-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
Is I-PER:Group
- I-PER:Group
Israelis I-PER:Group
are O
there B-LOC:Region-International
and O
they B-PER:Group
're O
there B-LOC:Region-International
to O
stay O
-- O
and O
, O
um O
, O
we B-GPE:Nation
going O
to O
have O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
coexist O
. O

If O
they B-PER:Group
can O
find O
somebody B-PER:Indeterminate
like I-PER:Indeterminate
that I-PER:Indeterminate
, O
then O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
they B-PER:Group
should O
f O
- O
support O
him B-PER:Indeterminate
and O
, O
um O
, O
and O
back O
him B-PER:Indeterminate
up O
-- O
in O
trying O
to O
help O
define O
-- O
peace O
in O
the B-LOC:Region-International
area I-LOC:Region-International
where B-LOC:Region-International
peace O
is O
impossible O
. O

What O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
about O
it O
? O

I B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
know O
that O
much O
about O
it O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
much O
into O
politics O
back O
in O
the O
eighties O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
was O
more O
, O
um O
, O
kind O
of O
a O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
a B-PER:Individual
kid I-PER:Individual
on I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
run I-PER:Individual
from I-PER:Individual
abusive I-PER:Individual
parents I-PER:Individual
back O
then O
so O
that O
was O
n't O
a O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
one O
of O
my B-PER:Individual
topics O
of O
interest O
at O
the O
time O
, O
it O
is O
now O
. O

Um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
my B-PER:Individual
roommate I-PER:Individual
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
still O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
much O
about O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
love O
to O
know O
more O
about O
politics O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
trying O
to O
learn O
more O
, O
uh O
, O
tells O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
such O
a B-PER:Individual
terrible I-PER:Individual
man I-PER:Individual
but O
, O
eh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
listen O
to O
everything O
he B-PER:Individual
says O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
-- O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
peace O
over O
there B-LOC:Region-International
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
agree O
with O
you B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
ever O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
not O
the O
way O
-- O
-- O
not O
the O
way O
they B-PER:Group
'll O
-- O
-- O
not O
like O
it O
is O
here B-GPE:Nation
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
agree O
that O
we B-GPE:Nation
should O
n't O
send O
people B-PER:Group
over O
there B-LOC:Region-International
. O

We B-GPE:Nation
've O
got O
enough O
stuff O
going O
on O
with O

Barb B-PER:Individual
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
and O
I B-PER:Individual
- O
and O

mean O
, O
we B-GPE:Nation
we B-GPE:Nation
ca O
n't O
, O
the O
that O
's O

Barb B-PER:Individual
that O
would O
be O
just O
putting O
it O
over O
the O
edge O
right O
there O
. O

But O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
ought O
support O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
a B-PER:Indeterminate
man I-PER:Indeterminate
that B-PER:Indeterminate
, O

Barb B-PER:Individual
like O

would O
like O
to O
coexist O

with O
everybody B-PER:Group
and O
somebody B-PER:Indeterminate
that B-PER:Indeterminate
is O

Barb B-PER:Individual
peaceful O
-- O
and O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
like O
to O
learn O
more O
about O

Bible O
. O

My B-PER:Group
parents I-PER:Group
never O
took O
me B-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual
know O
that O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
there O
's O
been O
problems O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
conflict O
over O
there B-LOC:Region-International
, O
and O
it O
seems O
like O
no O
matter O
what O
, O

Barb B-PER:Individual
just O
like O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
ye O
- O
eh O
, O
we B-GPE:Nation
try O
to O
go O
in O

and O
- O
and O
how O
long O
has O
it O
been O
and O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
Saddam B-PER:Individual
needed O
to O
be O
removed O
but O
it O
's O
- O
-- O
there O
's O
just O
-- O
s O
- O
all B-PER:Group
these I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
that B-PER:Group
are O
going O
to O
follow O
him B-PER:Individual
no O
matter O
what O
. O

Roger B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
and O
, O
um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
only O
know O
about O
Yasser B-PER:Individual
Arafat I-PER:Individual
because O
I B-PER:Individual
, O
um O
, O
study O
international O
affairs O
a O
little O
bit O
-- O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
know O
-- O
a O
very O
little O
bit O
about O
him B-PER:Individual
because O
, O
of O
course O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
a B-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
um I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
longer O
than O
the O
age O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
am O
-- O
old O
, O
so O
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
- O
I B-PER:Individual
- O
I B-PER:Individual
- O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
noticed O
-- O
on O
throughout O
my B-PER:Individual
studies O
that O
-- O
what O
he B-PER:Individual
represented O
to O
the B-PER:Group
public I-PER:Group
-- O
was O
-- O
what O
he B-PER:Individual
represented O
to O
the B-PER:Group
international I-PER:Group
public I-PER:Group
-- O
was O
not O
what O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
representing O
to O
his B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
-- O
and O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
representing O
, O
um O
, O
peace O
with O
the B-PER:Group
Israelis I-PER:Group
and O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
representing O
trying O
to O
find O
( O
( O
the B-PER:Group
whites I-PER:Group
or O
) O
) O
divide O
the B-LOC:Region-International
land I-LOC:Region-International
so O
that O
it B-LOC:Region-International
would O
be O
, O
um O
, O
stop O
, O
um O
, O
uh O
, O
war O
and O
terrorists B-PER:Group
in O
the B-LOC:Region-International
area I-LOC:Region-International
. O

But O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
the O
same O
image O
to O
- O
to O
his B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
it O
was O
a O
front O
-- O
for O
him B-PER:Individual
to O
allow O
to O
to O
be O
accepted O
in O
an B-GPE:Nation
international I-GPE:Nation
community I-GPE:Nation
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
that O
his B-PER:Individual
ultimate O
plans O
and O
goals O
were O
to O
to O
run O
the B-PER:Group
Israelis I-PER:Group
out O
-- O
maybe O
closer O
to O
the B-LOC:Region-General
Gaza I-LOC:Region-General
strip I-LOC:Region-General
, O
and O
to O
re O
-take O
Jerusalem B-GPE:Population-Center
-- O
and O
other B-GPE:Population-Center
cities I-GPE:Population-Center
near I-GPE:Population-Center
Jerusalem I-GPE:Population-Center
, O
and O
to O
, O
uh O
, O
uplift O
his B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
in O
a O
way O
that O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
could O
say O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
we B-PER:Group
conquered O
the B-PER:Group
Israelis I-PER:Group
. O

It O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
, O
uh O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
it O
's O
more O
than O
just O
land O
, O
it O
's O
a O
, O
um O
, O
conflict O
of O
- O
-- O
of O
, O
um O
, O
hatred O
, O
uh O
, O
and O
racism O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
eh O
, O
different O
types O
of O
people B-PER:Group
, O
um O
, O
they B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
like O

by O
the O
way O
I B-PER:Individual

from O

he B-PER:Individual
was O
a B-PER:Individual
good I-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual

and O
, O
um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
believe O
what O
, O
eh O
, O
has O
to O
be O
done O
-- O
right O
now O
is O
to O
( O
( O
apply O
) O
) O
-- O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
United I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Nations I-ORG:Non-Governmental
' O
, O
uh O
, O
decisions O
about O
the O
conflict O
between O
Arab B-PER:Group
and O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
because O
there O
is O
-- O
-- O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
, O
uh O
, O
decisions O
have O
been O
made O
-- O
have O
been O
made O
-- O
and O
this O
, O
uh O
- O
For O
example O
, O
one O
of O
them O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
decision O
number O
two O
forty O
- O
two O
-- O
and O
this O
was O
about O
-- O
the O
ha O
- O
establishing O
two O
- O
two B-GPE:Nation
countries I-GPE:Nation
, O
one B-GPE:Nation

Israel I-GPE:Nation
and O
another B-GPE:Nation
one I-GPE:Nation
for I-GPE:Nation
Palestine I-GPE:Nation

Ali B-PER:Individual
So O
, O
if O
we B-GPE:Nation
-- O
-- O
eh O
, O
if O
United B-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
, O
Bush B-PER:Individual
, O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
( O
( O
told O
) O
) O
th O
- O
the O
solution O
or O
to O
, O
uh O
, O
to O
make O
the O
decision O
, O
eh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
this O
will O
solve O
-- O
the O
problem O
. O

The O
-- O
unfortunately O
what O
happens O
right O
now O
- O
-- O
The O
-- O
for O
example O
, O
which O
is O
-- O
little O
bit O
toward O
it O
's O
- O
it O
's O
interest O
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
there O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
like O
, O
a O
-- O
decision O
against O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
, O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
-- O
went O
directly O
-- O
to O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
to O
-- O
-- O
for O
, O
eh O
, O
uh O
, O
an O
invasion O
-- O
and O
-- O
for O
-- O
whatever O
reasons O
- O
-- O
she B-GPE:Nation
even O
was O
out O
, O
uh O
, O
putting O
any O
attention O
to O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
United I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Nations I-ORG:Non-Governmental
, O
uh O
, O
like O
, O
uh O
, O
approval O
. O

She B-GPE:Nation
did O
wha O
- O
what O
she B-GPE:Nation
want O
. O

But O
, O
eh O
, O
eh O
, O
for O
Israeli B-GPE:Nation
, O
Palestinian B-GPE:Special
conflict O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
decisions O
that O
has O
to O
be O
-- O
applied O
but O
until O
now O
-- O
she B-GPE:Nation
did O
n't O
put O
any O
pressure O
, O
eh O
, O
toward O
( O
( O
this O
and O
) O
) O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
believe O
this O
policy O
has O
been O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
policy O
, O
eh O
, O
um O
, O
eh O
, O
became O
more O
and O
more O
during O
-- O
eh O
, O
during O
, O
uh O
, O
eh O
, O
Bush B-PER:Individual
-- O
-- O
President B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
time O
. O

For O
example O
, O
before O
, O
eh O
, O
during O
Clinton B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
believe O
at O
that O
time O
-- O
Clinton B-PER:Individual
was O
trying O
hard O
-- O
to O
solve O
this O
problem O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
believe O
at O
that O
time O
, O
if O
you B-PER:Individual
remember O
, O
um O
, O
Yasser B-PER:Individual
Arafat I-PER:Individual
-- O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
the B-PER:Individual
prime I-PER:Individual
minister I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
Israel I-PER:Individual
, O
his B-PER:Individual
name O
was O
Barak B-PER:Individual
, O
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental
met O
together O
in O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
White I-FAC:Building-Grounds
House I-FAC:Building-Grounds
-- O
and O
-- O
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental
almost O
came O
to O
an O
agreement O
-- O
to O
solve O
this O
problem O
-- O
and O
during O
Clinton B-PER:Individual
, O
eh O
, O
period O
-- O
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental
had O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
( O
( O
Oslo B-GPE:Population-Center
) O
) O
a O
- O
eh O
, O
agreement O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
big O
problems O
between O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
two I-ORG:Non-Governmental
parties I-ORG:Non-Governmental
, O
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental
negotiated O
everything O
almost O
and O
there O
is O
-- O
there O
were O
, O
like O
, O
final O
steps O
that O
have O
to O
be O
solved O
. O

But O
, O
uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
if O
there O
was O
, O
like O
, O
the O
, O
um O
, O
the O
same O
policy O
has O
to O
be O
followed O
after O
Clinton B-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
everything O
would O
- O
-- O
- O
finished O
then O
- O
-- O
the O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
United B-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
-- O
went O
to O
another O
direction O
and O
, O
eh O
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
forgot O
about O
this O
problem O
right O
now O
. O

Mark B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
g O
- O
eh O
, O
see O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
, O

Mark B-PER:Individual
um O
, O
when O
- O
when O
policy O
is O
set O
by O
one O
-- O
-- O
by O
one B-PER:Individual
president I-PER:Individual
-- O
towards O
- O
towards O
one O
thing O
, O
it O
's O
usually O
-- O
followed O
through O
, O
if O
there O
is O
something O
to O
follow O
through O
, O
by O
the B-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
next I-PER:Individual
president I-PER:Individual
in I-PER:Individual
turn I-PER:Individual
. O

He B-PER:Individual
is O
more O
or O
less O
obligated O
-- O
to O
continue O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
process O
that O
was O
already O
started O
-- O
but O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
Bush B-PER:Individual
's O
-- O
agenda O
-- O
is O
not O
-- O
towards O
that O
right O
now O
. O

That O
is O
not O
his B-PER:Individual
priority O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
. O

Ali B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
so O
, O
yes O
. O

And O
, O
eh O
, O
uh O
, O
although O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
it O
's O
been O
a O
long O
time O
-- O
that O
-- O
i O
- O
they B-GPE:Nation
have O
both O
-- O
b O
- O
both O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
and O
Palestine B-GPE:Special
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
both O
need O
a O
-- O
they B-GPE:Nation
both O
need O
their B-GPE:Nation
own I-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation
-- O
and O
- O

Ali B-PER:Individual
That O
's O
, O
uh O
, O
true O
because O

already O

Ali B-PER:Individual
The O

uh O
, O
there O

uh O

there O
has O
to O
be O
two B-GPE:Nation
countries I-GPE:Nation
, I-GPE:Nation
one I-GPE:Nation
of I-GPE:Nation
them I-GPE:Nation

another B-GPE:Nation

, O
his B-PER:Individual
double O

and O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
was O

Ken B-PER:Individual

For O
a B-PER:Group
lot I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
folks I-PER:Group

Michael B-PER:Individual
Jackson I-PER:Individual
thing O

. O

Remember O
the O
parakeet O
in O

, O
Gilligan O
's O
Island O
, O

it O
's O
like O
nothing O

phasing O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
and O

Do O

it O
? O

Paul B-PER:Individual
when O
they B-PER:Group

kind O
of O
weird O
. O

Paul B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
i O

think O
that O
he B-PER:Individual

did O
it O
. O

Ken B-PER:Individual
Eh O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
, O
eh O
, O
w O
- O
it O
seemed O
like O
he B-PER:Individual
covered O
his B-PER:Individual
tracks O
, O
though O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
they B-PER:Group
have O
no O
evidence O
other O
than O
the B-PER:Group
bodies I-PER:Group
that B-PER:Group
they B-PER:Group
found O
. O

So O
, O
it O
's O
crazy O
, O
but O
, O
they B-PER:Group
're O
saying O
where B-FAC:Building-Grounds
they B-PER:Group
're O
going O
to O
put O
him B-PER:Individual

and O
why O
? O

What O

the O
most O
memorable O
criminal B-PER:Individual
trial O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
can O
recall O
? O

Winnette B-PER:Individual
Hi O
, O
this B-PER:Individual
is O
Winnette B-PER:Individual
, O
in O
Michigan B-GPE:State-or-Province
. O

Irvin B-PER:Individual
Hi O
this B-PER:Individual
is O
Irvin B-PER:Individual
, O
Sullivan B-GPE:Population-Center
, I-GPE:Population-Center
Illinois I-GPE:Population-Center
. O

Uh O
, O
what O
do O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
about O
this O
Scott B-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
Peterson I-PER:Individual
trial O
? O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
much O
about O
it O
, O
to O
be O
honest O
with O
you B-PER:Individual
. O

Oh O
this O
is O
funny O
because O
I B-PER:Individual
just O
, O
one O
of O
my B-PER:Individual
calls O
the O
other O
day O
was O
regarding O
this O
. O

So O
uh O
uh O
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental
're O
act O
- O
-- O
actually O
that O
's O
getting O
a O
few O
different O
questions O
and O
-- O
actually O
the B-PER:Individual
gentleman I-PER:Individual
I I-PER:Individual
got I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
other I-PER:Individual
day I-PER:Individual
-- O
had O
n't O
even O
heard O
about O
it O
. O

Well O
um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
been O
following O
it O
pretty O
closely O
. O

Um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
because O
of O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
it O
being O
a B-PER:Individual
mother I-PER:Individual
and O
-- O
being O
pregnant O
for O
a B-PER:Individual
baby I-PER:Individual
. O

Um O
, O
kind O
of O
hit O
more O
to O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
to O
home O
. O

So O
you B-PER:Individual
-- O
how O
much O
of O
it O
have O
you B-PER:Individual
followed O
? O

Did O
, O
did O
you B-PER:Individual
-- O
follow O
any O
of O
it O
at O
all O
when O
it O
was O
on O
in O
the O
news O
or O
in O
the B-ORG:Media
papers I-ORG:Media
or O
anything O
? O

Irvin B-PER:Individual
Hardly O
any O
of O
it O
at O
all O
, O
because O
-- O
um O
-- O
for O
one O
thing O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
not O
have O
a O
~ O
TV O
or O
a O
radio O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
get O
a B-ORG:Media
daily I-ORG:Media
newspaper I-ORG:Media
. O

Irvin B-PER:Individual
we B-PER:Group
get O
a B-ORG:Media
weekly I-ORG:Media
newspaper I-ORG:Media
. O

Um O
, O
well O
I B-PER:Individual
'll O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
get O
any B-ORG:Media
newspapers I-ORG:Media
at O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
house I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
but O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
listen O
to O
the O
radio O
every O
morning O
on O
my B-PER:Individual
way O
to O
work O
and O

Winnette B-PER:Individual
and O
uh O
-- O
when O
it O
first O
happened O
it O
was O
-- O
pretty O
publicized O
on O
every O
radio O
station O
um O
-- O
it O
come O
across O
-- O
on O
the O
news O
and O
we B-ORG:Commercial
keep O
our B-ORG:Commercial
~ O
TV O
on O
at O
my B-PER:Individual
work O
, O
because O
we B-ORG:Commercial
have O
a B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
customer I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
waiting I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
area I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
, O
so O

Winnette B-PER:Individual
um O
actually O
one B-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
our I-PER:Individual
employees I-PER:Individual
had O
wa O
- O
watched O
( O
( O
happening O
) O
) O

-- O
so O
from O
that O
point O
on O
we B-PER:Group
kind O
of O
-- O
talked O
a O
lot O
about O
it O
at O
work O
and O

How O
long O
ago O
was O
it O
? O

Um O
, O
it O
was O
a O
year O
-- O
almost O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

Because O
it O
was O
just O
before O
Christmas O
-- O
that O
it O
happened O
. O

Irvin B-PER:Individual
Over O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

Um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
thinking O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
, O
November O
, O
December O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
sure O
exactly O
. O

But O
I B-PER:Individual
know O
it O
was O
just O
before O
Christmas O
-- O
when O
they B-PER:Group
had O
uh O
-- O
it O
had O
happened O
, O
because O
she B-PER:Individual
was O
missing O
during O
Christmas O
and O
then O
they B-PER:Group
had O
found O
her B-PER:Individual
body I-PER:Individual
. O

And O
they B-PER:Group
-- O
they B-PER:Group
found O
the B-PER:Individual
baby I-PER:Individual
as O
well O
. O

Um O
, O
so O
when O
they B-PER:Group
found O
the B-PER:Individual
baby I-PER:Individual
, O
the B-PER:Individual
baby I-PER:Individual
of O
course O
had O
been O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the B-PER:Individual
baby I-PER:Individual
was O
born O
, O
through O
delivery O
, O
or O
-- O
if O
maybe O
from O
um O
-- O
the B-PER:Individual
corpse I-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
guess O

Irvin B-PER:Individual
So O
the B-PER:Individual
baby I-PER:Individual
was O
separate O
. O

Um O
, O
actually O
she B-PER:Individual
was O
pregnant O
for O
the B-PER:Individual
baby I-PER:Individual
. O

But O
the B-PER:Individual
baby I-PER:Individual
was O
separate O
from O
the B-PER:Individual
body I-PER:Individual
when O
he B-PER:Group
found O
it B-PER:Individual
? O

Um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
if O
ma O
- O

I B-PER:Individual
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
the O
whole O
story O
for O
sure O
, O
but O
-- O
um O
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
obviously O
-- O
denied O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
involved O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

Then O
they B-PER:Group
found O
out O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
having O
an O
affair O
on O
her B-PER:Individual
. O

And O
-- O
then O
of O
course O
when O
they B-PER:Group
were O
investigating O
him B-PER:Individual
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
tried O
running O
. O

Dyed O
his B-PER:Individual
hair O
and O
-- O
grew O
out O
a O
mustache O
and O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
caught O
him B-PER:Individual
trying O
to O
run O
with O
-- O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
cash O
. O

Winnette B-PER:Individual
he B-PER:Individual
's O
-- O
in O
all O
honesty O
been O
guilty O
all O
along O
the O
way O
but O

Winnette B-PER:Individual
of O
course O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
they B-PER:Group
've O
got O
to O
give O
him B-PER:Individual
that O
reasonable O
doubt O
. O

So O
is O
he B-PER:Individual
is O
he B-PER:Individual
still O
um O
-- O
in O
prison B-FAC:Building-Grounds
now O
? O

And O
they B-PER:Group
're O
making O
the O
determination O
if O
-- O
in O
fact O
he B-PER:Individual
will O
get O
the B-Sentence
death I-Sentence
penalty I-Sentence
, O
or O
life B-Sentence
in I-Sentence
prison I-Sentence
. O

So O
that O
's O
what O
's O
is O
up O
in O
the O
air O
right O
now O
. O

What B-GPE:State-or-Province
state I-GPE:State-or-Province
is O
this O
in O
? O

Winnette B-PER:Individual
And O
-- O
um O
-- O

I B-PER:Individual
know O
I B-PER:Individual
had O
, O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
be O
deliberated O
on O
-- O
the O
twenty O
- O
second O
of O
November O
, O
but O
they B-PER:Group
had O
an O
issue O
happen O
with O
-- O
one B-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
jurors I-PER:Individual
-- O
so O
it O
's O
postponed O
everything O
. O

But O
, O
actually O
they B-PER:Group
were O
trying O
to O
pass O
a O
law O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
ever O
did O
take O
into O
effect O
, O
that O
if O
in O
fact O
a B-PER:Individual
mother I-PER:Individual
was O
killed O
, O
and O
pregnant O
, O
um O
-- O
for O
there O
to O
be O
a B-Crime
double I-Crime
murder I-Crime
charge O
. O

Winnette B-PER:Individual
And O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
were O
in O
fact O
trying O
to O
enforce O
the B-Sentence
death I-Sentence
penalty I-Sentence
on O
that O
charge O
if O
they B-PER:Indeterminate
were O
-- O
found O
guilty O
on O
both O
charges O
. O

Winnette B-PER:Individual
And O
-- O
so O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
up O
in O
the O
air O
now O
-- O
because O
he B-PER:Individual
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
believe O
he B-PER:Individual
got O
first B-Crime
degree I-Crime
murder I-Crime
and O
-- O
um O
and O
then O
got O
manslaughter B-Crime
on O
the B-PER:Individual
baby I-PER:Individual
. O

So O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
get O
both O
first B-Crime
degree I-Crime
murders I-Crime
. O

Um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
because O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
murder O
the B-PER:Individual
baby I-PER:Individual
directly O
. O

Winnette B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
thinking O
maybe O
was O
the O
difference O
. O

And O
because O
of O
the O
the O
charge O
on O
the B-PER:Individual
baby I-PER:Individual
, O
they B-PER:Group
could O
n't O
automatically O
give O
him B-PER:Individual
the B-Sentence
death I-Sentence
penalty I-Sentence
, O
but O
-- O
obviously O
there O
's O
enough O
-- O
um O
, O
complaints O
or O
whatever O

What O
was O
his B-PER:Individual
excuse O
for O
doing O
something O
horrible O
like O
that O
? O

Winnette B-PER:Individual
and O
-- O
well O
he B-PER:Individual
still O
denies O
everything O
. O

But O
the O
only O
thing O
they B-PER:Group
can O
figure O
is O
that O
maybe O
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
wanted O
back O
into O
the O
bachelor B-PER:Individual
life O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
a B-PER:Individual
father I-PER:Individual
, O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
tied O
down O
with O
a B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
and I-PER:Individual
child I-PER:Individual

So O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
have O
any B-PER:Group
other I-PER:Group
children I-PER:Group
? O

Winnette B-PER:Individual
that O
was O
-- O
No O
, O
that B-PER:Individual
was O
going O
to O
be O
their B-PER:Individual
first I-PER:Individual
. O

And O
actually O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
even O
think O
they B-PER:Group
were O
married O
that O
long O
, O
maybe O
a O
year O
or O
two O
. O

uh O
, O

And O
we B-GPE:State-or-Province
were O
kind O
of O
split O
in O
the O
middle O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Maybe O
we B-GPE:State-or-Province
're O
half O
blue B-ORG:Non-Governmental
and O
half O
red B-ORG:Non-Governmental
. O

So O
, O
you B-PER:Individual
voted O
for O
Bush B-PER:Individual
, O
then O
? O

No O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
voted O
for O
Kerry B-PER:Individual
. O

But O
, O
uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
live O
in O
a B-GPE:State-or-Province
kind I-GPE:State-or-Province
of I-GPE:State-or-Province
a I-GPE:State-or-Province
staunchly I-GPE:State-or-Province
-- I-GPE:State-or-Province
Republican I-GPE:State-or-Province
state I-GPE:State-or-Province
. O

So O
, O
there O
was O
really O
no O
way O
for O
my B-PER:Individual
vote O
to O
make O
a O
difference O
. O

Lynn B-PER:Individual
Which O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
just O
think O
the O
electoral O
votes O
-- O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
what O
's O
wrong O
with O
everybody B-PER:Group
just O
taking O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
a O
head O
count O
and O
voting O

Lynn B-PER:Individual
and O
doing O
away O
with O
the O
* O
electorials O
. O

Well O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
you B-PER:Individual
're O
you B-PER:Individual
're O
talking O
about O
, O
um O
, O
the O
Constitution O
there O
, O
so O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
it O
takes O
a O
lot O
to O
change O
the O
Constitution O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
know O
they B-PER:Group
're O
also O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
been O
reading O
some O
articles O
lately O
about O
they B-PER:Group
're O
-- O
thinking O
about O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
why O
should O
only O
a B-PER:Individual
native I-PER:Individual
born I-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
be O
allowed O
to O
, O
uh O
, O
be O
President B-PER:Individual
. O

That O
is O
kind O
of O
interesting O
to O
-- O
think O
that O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
'll O
be O
a O
long O
time O
before O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
would O
change O
that O
. O

Dave B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
just O
in O
the O
last O
uh O
, O
well O
, O
actually O
just O
in O
the O
last O
month O
or O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
is O
really O
the O
only O
time O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
ever O
heard O
anybody B-PER:Indeterminate
even O
even O
talk O
about O
it O
. O

And O
, O
uh O
, O
well O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
did O
read O
a O
a O
column O
today O
by O
, O
uh O
, O
a B-PER:Individual
Hispanic I-PER:Individual
fellow I-PER:Individual
and O
, O
uh O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
native O
born O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
from O
Cuba B-GPE:Nation
, O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
stated O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
we O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
in O
the O
fifth O
grade O
and O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
taking O
-- O
no O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
in O
middle O
school O
and O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
taking O
a O
civics O
class O
and O
and O
it O
was O
pointed O
out O
to O
him B-PER:Individual
that O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
could O
never O
become O
President B-PER:Individual
. O

And O
he B-PER:Individual
stated O
at O
that O
time O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
said O
, O
well O
, O
okay O
I B-PER:Individual

President B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
'll O
never O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
get O
involved O
in O
politics O
. O

So O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
kind O
of O
thought O
that O
was O
unfair O
. O

Well O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
in O
one O
sense O
it O
is O
but O
then O
, O
I B-PER:Individual

-- O
well O
, O
my B-PER:Group
grandparents I-PER:Group
came O
over O
, O
Ellis B-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
Island I-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
and O
everything O
, O
but O
when O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
about O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
a B-PER:Individual
foreign I-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
or O
maybe O
born O
in O
another B-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation
and O
coming O
here B-GPE:Nation
it O
doe O
- O
it O
does O
n't O
seem O
right O
in O
one O
sense O
for O
-- O
for O
them B-PER:Individual
to O
be O
able O
to O
be O
President B-PER:Individual
of O
this B-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation
. O

of O
falls O
like O
-- O

I B-PER:Individual
've O
been O
on O
the O
internet O
lately O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
ran O
across O
these O
really O
weird O
websites O
-- O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
a B-PER:Individual
fanatic I-PER:Individual
or O
anything O
but O
they O
're O
all O
about O
the O
-- O
the O
new O
world B-LOC:Region-International
, O
one B-ORG:Government
world I-ORG:Government
government I-ORG:Government
and O
things O
like O
that O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
and O
to O
me B-PER:Individual

just O
another O
point O
in O
that O
direction O
. O

Lynn B-PER:Individual

wo O
n't O
make O
a O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
twenty O
or O
thirty O
, O
forty O
, O
fifty O

down O
the O
road O
. O

think O
about O
George B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual

think O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
a B-PER:Individual
phony I-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
that O
's O
another O
thing O
they B-PER:Group
were O
talking O
about O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
is O
with O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
Skull I-ORG:Non-Governmental
and I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Bones I-ORG:Non-Governmental
from O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
went O
to O
Yale B-ORG:Educational
, O

Lynn B-PER:Individual
and O
so O
was O
his B-PER:Individual
father I-PER:Individual

Skull I-PER:Individual
and I-PER:Individual
Bones I-PER:Individual
, O

-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
what O
else O
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental
're O
called O
but O
they B-PER:Group
're O
saying O
, O
like O
, O
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental
were O
like O
Satan B-ORG:Non-Governmental
people I-ORG:Non-Governmental
, O
Satan B-ORG:Non-Governmental
worshipers I-ORG:Non-Governmental
and O
, O

Lynn B-PER:Individual
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
and O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
believe O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
watched O
a O
show O
on O
channel O
nine O
about O
Bush B-PER:Individual
and O
him B-PER:Individual
being O
religious O
, O
spiritual O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
also O
religious O
when O
his B-PER:Individual
father I-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
, O
and O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
all O
a O
bunch O
of O
lies O
, O
and O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
crazy O
about O
Bush B-PER:Individual
. O

There O
're O
some O
things O
about O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
does O
act O
spiritual O
and O
things O
like O
that O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
like O
that O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
's O
what O
got O
him B-PER:Individual
in O
office O
but O
, O

Well O
what O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
of O
him B-PER:Individual
as O
a B-PER:Individual
man I-PER:Individual
? O

Do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
, O
uh O
, O
a B-PER:Individual
good I-PER:Individual
man I-PER:Individual
or O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
got O
-- O
any O
good O
qualities O
, O
or O

Lynn B-PER:Individual
Uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
want O
to O
say O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
probably O
is O
but O
then O
I B-PER:Individual
look O
at O
the O
things O
like O
where O
he B-PER:Individual
wants O
-- O
the O
things O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
done O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
people B-PER:Group
are O
poorer O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
just O
think O
the O
um O
, O
we B-GPE:Nation
're O
so O
much O
more O
in O
debt O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
just O
do O
n't O
think O
he B-PER:Individual
-- O
-- O
But O
as O
far O
as O
the B-PER:Individual
man I-PER:Individual
himself I-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
again O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
. O

What O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
of O
him B-PER:Individual
? O

Well O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
his B-PER:Individual
dad I-PER:Individual
was O
a B-PER:Individual
better I-PER:Individual
man I-PER:Individual
than I-PER:Individual
he I-PER:Individual
is I-PER:Individual
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
kind O
of O
in O
the O
same O
boat O
you B-PER:Individual
're O
in O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
just O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
kind O
of O
the O
sizzle O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
not O
the O
steak O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
just O
sold O
to O
the B-PER:Group
American I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
. O

. O

Obo B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
did O

but O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
vote O
for O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
main I-ORG:Non-Governmental
party I-ORG:Non-Governmental

Obo B-PER:Individual
ever O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
usually O
try O
to O
stay O
out O
of O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
main I-ORG:Non-Governmental
party I-ORG:Non-Governmental
, O
because O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
, O
and O
this O
last O
election O
showed O
that O
both B-ORG:Non-Governmental
are O
very O
brutal O
. O

Obo B-PER:Individual
Um O
, O
yeah O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
the O
, O
uh O

It O
was O
a O
very O
brutal O
election O
. O

Obo B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
yeah O
, O
it O
's O
, O
yeah O
, O
you B-PER:Individual
're O
absolutely O
, O
yeah O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
sorry O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
if O
you B-PER:Individual
want O
to O
add O
anything O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
sorry O
. O

No O
no O
, O
go O
ahead O
, O
go O
ahead O
. O

Obo B-PER:Individual
And O
, O
ah O
-- O
It O
's O
, O
it O
's O
just O
that O
-- O
Like O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
just O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
the O
last O
fifty O
years O
, O
the B-GPE:Nation
government I-GPE:Nation
has O
been O
mes O
- O
messed O
up O
by O
both B-ORG:Non-Governmental
these I-ORG:Non-Governmental
parties I-ORG:Non-Governmental
, O
honestly O
. O

So O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
usually O
do O
third B-ORG:Non-Governmental
party I-ORG:Non-Governmental
-- O
um O
, O
and O
the O
way O
it O
was O
working O
this O
year O
was O
that O
the B-PER:Group
Democrats I-PER:Group
really O
pushed O
to O
get O
Ralph B-PER:Individual
Nader I-PER:Individual
off O
the O
ballot O

Obo B-PER:Individual
in O
every B-GPE:State-or-Province
state I-GPE:State-or-Province
, O
and O
um O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
the B-PER:Group
Republicans I-PER:Group
sort O
of O
tried O
to O
play O
like O
they B-PER:Group
were O
helping O
him B-PER:Individual
out O
, O
but O
they B-PER:Group
knew O
they B-PER:Group
they B-PER:Group
did O
n't O
really O
have O
to O
because O
they B-PER:Group
knew O
the B-PER:Group
Democrats I-PER:Group
were O
already O
doing O
more O
damage O
to O
keep O
him B-PER:Individual
off O
the O
ballot O
and O
they B-PER:Group
were O
successful O
, O
and O
for O
a B-ORG:Non-Governmental
progressive I-ORG:Non-Governmental
party I-ORG:Non-Governmental
that O
was O
very O
brutal O
. O

Obo B-PER:Individual
And O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
really O
impressed O
by O
either B-PER:Indeterminate
of I-PER:Indeterminate
the I-PER:Indeterminate
two I-PER:Indeterminate
vice I-PER:Indeterminate
presidential I-PER:Indeterminate
candidates I-PER:Indeterminate
, O
I B-PER:Individual
know O
Dick B-PER:Individual
Cheney I-PER:Individual
seems O
to O
be O
running O
the O
show O

Obo B-PER:Individual
and O
, O
ah O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
and O
, O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
has O
to O
do O
-- O
and O
then O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
just O
did O
n't O
know O
much O
, O
John B-PER:Individual
Edwards I-PER:Individual
seemed O
nice O
, O
but O
he B-PER:Individual
just O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
just O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
just O
got O
elected O
to O
the B-ORG:Government
Senate I-ORG:Government
, O
and O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
really O
familiar O
too O
much O
with O
hi O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
great O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
got O
into O
the O
vice B-PER:Individual
presidential I-PER:Individual
role O
, O
but O
-- O
again O
, O
it O
's O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
whole I-ORG:Non-Governmental
parties I-ORG:Non-Governmental
that O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
really O
not O
really O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
like O
their B-ORG:Non-Governmental
policies O
. O

Ted B-PER:Individual

election O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
participated O
in O
. O

And O
the O
reason O
was O
was O
that O
, O
ah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
retired O
Air B-ORG:Government
Force I-ORG:Government
-- O
and O
before O
, O
ah O
, O
because O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
in O
the B-ORG:Government
military I-ORG:Government
-- O
ah O
, O
did O
n't O
did O
n't O
really O
think O
that O
my B-PER:Individual
vote O
, O
um O
, O
counted O
one O
way O
or O
the O
other O
, O
that O
's O
that O
was O
my B-PER:Individual
thinking O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
had O
a O
role O
to O
fulfill O
and O
regardless O
of O
how O
I B-PER:Individual
voted O
, O
uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
going O
to O
have O
to O
fulfill O
that O
role O
. O

Ted B-PER:Individual
the O
, O
the O
situation O
, O
though O
, O
now O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
out O
and O
, O
in O
the O
civilian B-PER:Group
sector O
, O
um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
find O
that O
the O
economics O
as O
far O
as O
home B-GPE:Nation
-- O
is O
what O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
most O
concerned O
with O
. O

And O
because O
of O
the O
economic O
situation O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
that O
's O
being O
addressed O
. O

Yes O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
feel O
very O
, O
very O
bad O
in O
regards O
to O
the O
, O
ah O
, O
nine O
- O
eleven O
tragedy O
and O
terrorism O
and O
this O
kind O
of O
stuff O

Ted B-PER:Individual
um O
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
so O
much O
attention O
is O
being O
paid O
to O
that O
-- O
that O
-- O
as O
you B-PER:Individual
mentioned O
, O
over O
the O
past O
fifty O
years O
, O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
two I-ORG:Non-Governmental
parties I-ORG:Non-Governmental
that B-ORG:Non-Governmental
run O
the B-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation
-- O
um O
, O
have O
definitely O
taken O
a O
, O
um O
-- O
streamlined O
approach O
to O
whatever O
their B-ORG:Non-Governmental
agenda O
may O
be O
and O
not O
the O
will O
of O
the B-GPE:Nation
people I-GPE:Nation
. O

You B-PER:Individual
said O
it O
very O
well O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
totally O
, O
you B-PER:Individual
coul O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
could O
n't O
have O
said O
it O

-- O
uh O

the B-GPE:Nation
biggest I-GPE:Nation
power I-GPE:Nation
in I-GPE:Nation
the I-GPE:Nation
world I-GPE:Nation

election O
stuff O
behind O
me B-PER:Individual
. O

Ivan B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
- O
in O
fact O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
thought O
we B-PER:Group
already O
had O
a O
discussion O
on O
this O
, O
uh O
, O
about O
elections O
some O
time O
back O
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
it O
was O
-- O
question O
was O
framed O
differently O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
. O

John B-PER:Individual
And O
, O
um O
, O
elections O
wore O
me B-PER:Individual
down O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
was O
pretty O
tired O
of O
all O
that O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
all O
the O
commercials O
and O
all O
the O
hype O
and O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
. O

It O
it O
we B-PER:Group
have O
lunch O
at O
work O
and O
-- O
the O
whole O
lunch O
time O
all O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
do O
is O
see O
commercials O
about O
the B-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
politicians I-PER:Group
and O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
all O
that O
kind O
of O
stuff O
, O
um O
, O

Ivan B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
, O
uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
voted O
. O

Um O
, O
uh O
, O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
feel O
the O
same O
way O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
get O
-- O
regardless O
of O
what O
year O
it O
is O
or O
who B-PER:Group
the B-PER:Group
candidates I-PER:Group
are O
I B-PER:Individual
get O
tired O
of O
listening O
to O
it O
. O

It O
-- O
basically O
all O
of O
it O
's O
the O
same O
thing O
all O
the O
time O
and O
, O
uh O
, O

Ivan B-PER:Individual
they B-PER:Group
, O
uh O
, O
tell O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
the O
same O
thing O
and O
then O
they B-PER:Group
turn O
around O
and O
-- O
do O
something O
different O
all O
the O
time O
anyway O
, O
so O
it O
's O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
, O
uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
it O
's O
wor O
- O
-- O
worth O
voting O
, O
but O
-- O
sometimes O
I B-PER:Individual
wonder O
. O

Was O
n't O
, O
uh O
, O
Wisconsin B-GPE:State-or-Province
was O
like O
a B-GPE:State-or-Province
swing I-GPE:State-or-Province
, O
er O
, O
uh O
, O
they B-PER:Group
were O
really O
pu O
- O
or O
no O
it O
was O
Ohio B-GPE:State-or-Province
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
, O
was O
the B-GPE:State-or-Province
really I-GPE:State-or-Province
, O
uh O
, O

Ivan B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
Ohio B-GPE:State-or-Province
was O
th O
- O
the B-GPE:State-or-Province
big I-GPE:State-or-Province
swing I-GPE:State-or-Province
one I-GPE:State-or-Province
. O

Ivan B-PER:Individual
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
it B-GPE:State-or-Province
was O
, O
uh O
, O
it B-GPE:State-or-Province
went O
, O
uh O
, O
what O
color O
was O
it B-GPE:State-or-Province
? O

Blue O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
it B-GPE:State-or-Province
was O
. O

Well O
, O
my B-PER:Group
parents I-PER:Group
live O
back O
there B-GPE:State-or-Province
still O
. O

In O

nice O
to O
meet O
you B-PER:Individual
. O

So O
, O
uh O
the O
election O
, O
um O
-- O
the O
, O
um O
-- O
let O
's O
see O
, O
overall O
I B-PER:Individual
felt O
-- O
ju O
- O
just O
give O
you B-PER:Individual
a O
brief O
-- O
summary O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
felt O
-- O
that O
-- O
John B-PER:Individual
Kerry I-PER:Individual
and O
Edwards B-PER:Individual
were O
were O
pretty B-PER:Group
strong I-PER:Group
candidates I-PER:Group
and O
-- O
uh O
-- O
mm O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
just O
in O
terms O
of O
policy O
I B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
, O
uh O
, O
find O
-- O
that O
as O
compelling O
as O
just O
-- O
the O
personality O
of O
-- O
the B-PER:Group
different I-PER:Group
candidates I-PER:Group
. O

Marco B-PER:Individual
felt O
like O
I B-PER:Individual
could O
trust O
Kerry B-PER:Individual
-- O
uh O
, O
little O
bit O
more O
even O
though O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
much O
more O
of O
a B-PER:Individual
politician I-PER:Individual
than O
Bush B-PER:Individual
. O

Marco B-PER:Individual
Uh O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
-- O
kind O
of O
a B-PER:Individual
smooth I-PER:Individual
talker I-PER:Individual
and O

Marco B-PER:Individual
Um O
-- O
uh O
-- O
seems O
like O
a B-PER:Individual
politician I-PER:Individual
, O
they O
way O
he B-PER:Individual
presented O

Marco B-PER:Individual
his B-PER:Individual
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
his B-PER:Individual
his B-PER:Individual
um O
argument O
. O

But O
-- O
uh O
-- O
strangely O
I B-PER:Individual
felt O
like O
that O
what O
, O
that O
was O
-- O
one O
of O
-- O
one O
of O
his B-PER:Individual
good O
qualities O
because O
I B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
feel O
Bush B-PER:Individual
was O
politician O
enough O
. O

That O
um O
-- O
one O
of O
the O
-- O
issues O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
concerned O
about O
was O
just O
-- O
the O
representation O
of O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
and O
-- O
on O
the O
international O
stage O

Marco B-PER:Individual
and O
I B-PER:Individual
just O
-- O
uh O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
uh O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
, O
uh O
, O
Bush B-PER:Individual
is O
-- O
the O
way O
he B-PER:Individual
presents O
um O
-- O
the O
~ O
US B-GPE:Nation
position O
-- O
uh O
-- O
seemed O
a O
little O
-- O
abrasive O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
felt O
like O
, O
hm O
-- O
if O
we B-GPE:Nation
're O
trying O
to O
, O
um O
-- O
make O
-- O
um O
-- O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
safer O
and O
more O
stable O
-- O
conflict O
in O
the B-LOC:Celestial
world I-LOC:Celestial
more O
stable O
then O
we B-GPE:Nation
probably O
need O
somebody B-PER:Individual
-- O
who B-PER:Individual
is O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
-- O
of O
a B-PER:Individual
politician I-PER:Individual
in O
the O
sense O
that O
-- O
the O
, O
they B-PER:Individual
care O
about O
diplomacy O
and O
-- O
uh O
, O
even O
though O
we B-GPE:Nation
may O
not O
-- O
give O
in O
to O
-- O
the O
will O
of O
the B-GPE:Nation
other I-GPE:Nation
nations I-GPE:Nation
present O
it O
in O
a O
nicer O
way O
. O

Marco B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
it O
seems O
( O
( O
I B-PER:Individual
make O
) O
) O
kind O
of O
simplistic O
, O
but O
-- O
that O
was O
-- O
an O
important O
thing O
for O
me B-PER:Individual
. O

Derek B-PER:Individual
Um O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
a O
little O
different O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
agree O
with O
everything O
you B-PER:Individual
said O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
just O
, O
um O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
come O
from O
a O
little O
different O
background O
as O
far O
as O
being O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
never O
into O
politics O
and O
now O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
actually O
have O
gotten O
into O
God B-PER:Individual
much O
more O
and O
and O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
searching O
spirituality O
out O
. O

Derek B-PER:Individual
Generally O
people B-PER:Group
like I-PER:Group
that I-PER:Group
are O
conservative O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O

Derek B-PER:Individual
uh O
, O
with O
their B-PER:Group
views O
because O
of O
different O
things O
like O
abortion O
and O
, O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
pro O
-life O
and O
-- O
all O
that O
kind O
of O
thing O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
came O
form O
that O
background O

Derek B-PER:Individual
eh O
, O
but O
that O
was O
just O
an O
added O
bonus O
for O
me B-PER:Individual
in O
the O
fact O
that O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
too O
was O
obviously O
at O
this O
point O
in O
time O
concerned O
about O
the O
welfare O
of O
our B-GPE:Nation
security O
-- O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
felt O
personally O
that O
if O
-- O
Kerry B-PER:Individual
was O
in O
office O
we B-GPE:Nation
'd O
kind O
of O
be O
, O
uh O
-- O
up O
a O
creek O
without O
a O
paddle O
because O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
is O
so O
laid O
back O
-- O
um O
, O
and O
not O
as O
aggressive O
as O
Bush B-PER:Individual
that O
at O
this O
point O
in O
the O
game O
, O
where O
we B-GPE:Nation
're O
at O
-- O
we B-GPE:Nation
're O
in O
this O
thing O
full O
full O
-- O
steam O
ahead O

Derek B-PER:Individual
and O
for O
a O
transition O
to O
occur O
at O
this O
point O
-- O
to O
someone B-PER:Individual
who B-PER:Individual
is O
laid O
back O
-- O
and O
not O
as O
aggressive O
as O
him B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
think O
would O
actually O
endanger O
the B-GPE:Nation
~ I-GPE:Nation
US I-GPE:Nation
even O
more O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
the B-PER:Group
international I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
uh I-PER:Group
uh I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
leaders I-PER:Group
would O
look O
at O
Kerry B-PER:Individual
and O
know O
, O
they B-PER:Group
're O
very O
smart O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
they B-PER:Group
're O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
're O
on O
top O
of O
these O
things O
, O
they B-PER:Group
know O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
it O
would O
, O
it O
just O
would O
have O
opened O
a O
gateway O
. O

Derek B-PER:Individual
that O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
may O
have O
actually O
put O
us B-GPE:Nation
in O
more O
danger O
. O

At O
least O
Bush B-PER:Individual
has O
-- O
pulled O
out O
the B-WEA:Shooting
gun I-WEA:Shooting
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
stick O
to O
them B-PER:Group
, O
and O
um O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
that O
's O
where O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
coming O
from O
on O
that O
. O

Derek B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
listen O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
talk O
radio O
and O
when O
I B-PER:Individual
heard O
the O
stuff O
about O
Kerry B-PER:Individual
back O
in O
the O
-- O
the O
the O
, O
apparently O
the O
scandals O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
pulled O
as O
far O
as O
the O
uh O
, O
medals O
when O
he B-PER:Individual
served O
time O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
uh O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
listen O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
talk O
radio O
and O
spoke O
with O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
heard O
from O
a B-PER:Group
lot I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
uh I-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
veterans I-PER:Group
-- O
and O
they B-PER:Group
said O
it O
was O
physically O
, O
uh O
, O
impossible O
for O
him B-PER:Individual
to O
achieve O
what O
he B-PER:Individual
said O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
. O

And O
all O
the O
meetings O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
missing O
, O
and O
just O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
more O
of O
a O
status O
quo O
for O
him B-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
more O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
got O
so O
much O
money O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
just O
concerned O
with O
attaining O
this O
position O
and O
a O
title O
. O

Derek B-PER:Individual
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
( O
( O
flag O
) O
) O
for O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
so O

Marco B-PER:Individual
Do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
, O
um O
-- O
the O
-- O
when O
the B-PER:Group
Republicans I-PER:Group
are O
campaigning O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
were O
saying O
that O
well O
, O
another O
attack O
on O
the B-GPE:Nation
U.S. I-GPE:Nation
is O
-- O
imminent O
, O
that O
it O
probably O
-- O
probably O
going O
to O
happen O
-- O
and O
-- O
um O
-- O
and O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
even O
went O
so O
far O
to O
say O
that O
if O
-- O
it O
's O
really O
difficult O
to O
prevent O
something O
like O
this O
and O
of O
course O
they B-PER:Group
're O
doing O
the O
best O
they B-PER:Group
can O
and O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
Kerry B-PER:Individual
would O
do O
the O
best O
he B-PER:Individual
could O
. O

But O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
, O
um O
-- O
that O
-- O
and O
this O
is O
n't O
quite O
a O
political O
issue O
, O
but O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
-- O
there O
's O
going O
to O
be O
another O
attack O
on O
the B-GPE:Nation
~US I-GPE:Nation
? O

Uh O
like O
in O
the O
next O
five O
years O
? O

Something O
big O
like O
-- O
the B-LOC:Celestial
world I-LOC:Celestial
( O
( O
) O
) O

Derek B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
what O
your B-PER:Individual
beliefs O
are O
, O
as O
far O
as O
, O
uh O
-- O
biblically O
or O
spiritually O
or O
whatever O
, O
but O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
believe O
it O
's O
inevitable O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
we B-GPE:Nation
're O
going O
down O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
? O

And O
, O
yeah O
, O
and O
this O
is O
, O
all O
these O
things O
have O
been O
written O
about O
actually O
. O

Derek B-PER:Individual
Um O
-- O
The O
tw O
- O
the O
uh O
-- O
what O
is O
it O
, O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
towers I-FAC:Building-Grounds

-- O
that O
was O
actually O
uh O

last O

after O
a O
lot O
of O
controversy O
surrounding O
his B-PER:Individual
illness O
and O

his B-PER:Individual
illness O
, O

it O
have O
been O
something O
malicious O
( O
like O
poisoning O
) O
? O

What O

think O
of O
Israel B-GPE:Nation

? O

Should O
President B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
or O
a B-PER:Individual
senior I-PER:Individual
US I-PER:Individual
official I-PER:Individual
have O
attended O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
's O
funeral O
? O

Should O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
have O
let O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
be O
buried O
in O
Jerusalem B-GPE:Population-Center
? O

on O
this O
one O
yesterday O
, O
same O
subject O
. O

James B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
believe O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
talked O
about O
this O
subject O
once O
before O
too O
. O

Uh O
, O
Well O
, O
let O
's O
see O
, O
my B-PER:Individual
past O
views O
were O
, O
uh O
-- O
illness O
- O
wise O
, O
ah O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
-- O
it O
helped O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
being O
in O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
compound I-FAC:Building-Grounds
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
're O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
're O
never O
going O
to O
know O
if O
there O
was O
any O
, O
ah O
, O
clandestine O
- O
type O
operation O
that O
-- O
Aided O
his B-PER:Individual
, O
ah O
-- O
ah O
, O
illness O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
they B-PER:Group
, O
ah O
, O
( O
( O
) O
) O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
're O
ever O
going O
to O
find O
out O
if O
there O
was O
any O
direct O

Ed B-PER:Individual
but O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
from O
just O
the O
generic O
point O
, O
or O
general O
point O
of O
view O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
help O
his B-PER:Individual
illness O
once O
he B-PER:Individual
got O
-- O
sick O
-- O
being O
in O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
compound I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
closed O
in O
like O
that O
with O
the B-PER:Group
Arabs I-PER:Group
. O

James B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
there O
was O
something O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
malicious O
done O
, O
because O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
looking O
back O
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
been O
had O
this O
shaking O
thing O
going O
on O

James B-PER:Individual
for O
quite O
some O
time O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
agree O
that O
the O
surroundings O
could O
n't O
have O
helped O
. O

James B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
it O
, O
it O
could O
've O
only O
exacerbated O
, O
uh O
, O
his B-PER:Individual
situation O
. O

Because O
for O
-- O
for O
a O
good O
little O
while O
now O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
noticed O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
that O
his B-PER:Individual
lips O
would O
tremble O
, O
and O

James B-PER:Individual
and O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
it O
's O
like O
, O
um O
, O
uh O
, O
almost O
like O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
, O
uh O
, O
what O
is O
that O
, O
Parkinson O
's O
? O

Uh O
, O
something O
like O
that O
, O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
what O
the O
exact O
conditions O
were O
-- O
in O
that B-FAC:Building-Grounds
compound I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
but O
they O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
, O
ah O
, O
conducive O
to O
someone B-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
his I-PER:Individual
age I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
and I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
his I-PER:Individual
health I-PER:Individual
-- O
and O
as O
far O
as O
, O
as O
, O
ah O
, O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
sending O
a B-PER:Individual
senior I-PER:Individual
~ I-PER:Individual
US I-PER:Individual
official I-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
they B-GPE:Nation
should O
've O
sent O
someone B-PER:Individual
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
how O
senior O
that B-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
had O
to O
be O
. O

But O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
could O
've O
been O
a O
gesture O

Well O
they B-GPE:Nation
did O
-- O
they B-GPE:Nation
did O
send O
somebody B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
thought O
. O

Did O
n't O
they B-GPE:Nation
go O
with O
a B-PER:Individual
senior I-PER:Individual
official I-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
had O

Ed B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
think O
they B-PER:Group
were O
going O
to O
ask O
this O
question O
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual

James B-PER:Individual
Oh O
y O
- O
yeah O
, O
you B-PER:Individual
're O
right O
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
did O
send O
someone B-PER:Individual
. O

Ed B-PER:Individual
but O
it B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
-- O
like O
, O
ah O
, O
was O
n't O
Bush B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
definitely O
would O
n't O
send O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
want O
to O
have O
him B-PER:Individual
in O
that B-LOC:Region-International
part I-LOC:Region-International
of I-LOC:Region-International
the I-LOC:Region-International
world I-LOC:Region-International
right O
now O
. O

Ed B-PER:Individual
Regardless O
of O
what O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
think O
about O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
, O
ah O

James B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
he B-PER:Individual
should O
have O
went O
-- O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
any B-PER:Individual
senior I-PER:Individual
official I-PER:Individual
should O
've O
went O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
-- O
Secretary B-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
State I-PER:Individual
Colin I-PER:Individual
Powell I-PER:Individual
should O
have O
went O
. O

Uh O
, O
whoever B-PER:Individual
they I-PER:Individual
sent I-PER:Individual
was O
, O
was O
good O
enough O
. O

James B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
was O
good O
enough O
, O
just O
to O
show O
-- O
the B-GPE:Special
Palestinian I-GPE:Special
people I-GPE:Special
-- O
that O
, O
uh O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
America B-GPE:Nation
does O
care O
somewhat O
-- O
that O
you B-GPE:Special
've O
lost O
your B-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
. O

But O
, O
uh O
, O
no O
, O
it O
would O
've O
been O
-- O
it O
would O
've O
been O
a O
wro O
- O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
sending O
Bush B-PER:Individual
would O
have O
made O
it O
worse O
. O

Uh O
, O
because O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
not O
liked O
that O
much O
by O
the B-GPE:Special
Palestinian I-GPE:Special
people I-GPE:Special
. O

So O
I B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
sending O
him B-PER:Individual
would O
've O
been O
-- O
would O
've O
been O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
. O

No O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
agree O
with O
that O
. O

James B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
've O
added O
anything O
to O
-- O
to O
the O
situation O
. O

and O
possibly O
could O
've O
made O
it O
worse O
. O

As O
to O
-- O
his B-PER:Individual
burial O

Ed B-PER:Individual
ah O
, O
Not O
anymore O
, O
these O
are O
all O
, O
uh O
like O
these O
are O
all O
political O
responses O

Ed B-PER:Individual
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
there O
is O
no O
right O
answer O
, O
considering O
that O
that O
is O
not O

Ed B-PER:Individual
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
're O
still O
arguing O
over O
-- O
that B-LOC:Region-International
land I-LOC:Region-International
, O
and O
is O
it O
, O
ah O

Ed B-PER:Individual
who B-GPE:Nation
owns O
it B-LOC:Region-International
and O
respect O
, O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
it O
's O

I B-PER:Individual
'd O
say O
my B-PER:Individual
overall O
opinion O
is O
that O
-- O
this O
conflict O
is O
way O
past O
that O
time O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
it O
's O
been O
going O
on O
for O
all O
these O
many O
-- O
what O
, O

James B-PER:Individual
hundreds O
of O
years O
-- O
and O
a B-PER:Group
lot I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
have O
lost O
their B-PER:Group
lives O
, O
and O
and O
a B-PER:Group
lot I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
kids I-PER:Group
have O
grown O
up O
and O
all O
they B-PER:Group
've O
ever O
known O
-- O
on O
both B-GPE:Nation
sides I-GPE:Nation
Israeli B-GPE:Nation
and O
Palestinian B-GPE:Special
, O
all O
they B-PER:Group
've O
ever O
known O
is O
war O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
that O
's O
, O
that O
's O
my B-PER:Individual
, O
my B-PER:Individual
view O
, O
this O
thing O
has O
gone O
so O
long O
-- O
like O
you B-PER:Individual
said O
, O
about O
a B-LOC:Region-International
piece I-LOC:Region-International
of I-LOC:Region-International
land I-LOC:Region-International
. O

And O
it O
's O
just O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
They B-GPE:Nation
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
got O
to O
learn O
at O
some O
point O
-- O
that O
they B-GPE:Nation
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
along O
. O

Or O
this O
is O
just O
going O
to O
keep O
going O
around O
, O
and O
around O
, O
and O
around O
, O
and O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
the O
the O
-- O
the B-GPE:Special
Palestinians I-GPE:Special
will O
, O
will O
, O
will O
-- O
will O
-- O
will O
do O
something O
, O
then O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
will O
respond O
, O
and O
then O
back O
and O
forth O
-- O
and O
it O
's O
just O
like O
a O
never O
ending O
circle O
. O

It O
's O
like O
a O
never O
ending O
circle O
of O
violence O
and O
death O
and O
destruction O
. O

And O
, O
like O
I B-PER:Individual
said O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
personally O
just O
tired O
of O
it O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
the B-LOC:Celestial
world I-LOC:Celestial
is O
just O
tired O
of O
it O
. O

And O
they B-GPE:Nation
need O
to O
try O
and O
, O
try O
and O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
have O
the O
answer O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
have O
all O
the O
answers O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
just O
know O
that O
it O
is O
just O
-- O
just O
an O
ongoing O
situation O
that O
is O
- O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
-- O
no O
end O
in O
sight O
. O

Death O
of O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
( O
2 O
) O
PLO B-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
PLO B-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
Yasser I-PER:Individual
Arafat I-PER:Individual
died O
in O
a B-FAC:Building-Grounds
Paris I-FAC:Building-Grounds
hospital I-FAC:Building-Grounds
last O
week O
, O
after O
a O
lot O
of O
controversy O
surrounding O
his B-PER:Individual
illness O
and O
death O
. O

What O
do O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
think O
caused O
his B-PER:Individual
illness O
, O
and O
could O
it O
have O
been O
something O
malicious O
( O
like O
poisoning O
) O
? O

What O
do O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
think O
of O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
's O
policies O
surrounding O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
's O
illness O
and O
death O
? O

Should O
President B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
or O
a B-PER:Individual
senior I-PER:Individual
US I-PER:Individual
official I-PER:Individual
have O
attended O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
's O
funeral O
? O

Should O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
have O
let O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
be O
buried O
in O
Jerusalem B-GPE:Population-Center
? O

Mike B-PER:Individual
Hi O
, O
this B-PER:Individual
is O
Mike B-PER:Individual
. O

Paul B-PER:Individual
Nice O
to O
meet O
you B-PER:Individual
, O
Mike B-PER:Individual
. O

Mike B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
nice O
to O
meet O
you B-PER:Individual
. O

Paul B-PER:Individual
Uh O
, O
well O
, O
pretty O
complicated O
-- O
topic O
. O

You B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
was O
poison O
? O

Paul B-PER:Individual
Well O
-- O
( O
( O
smoosh O
) O
) O
no O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
heard O
that O
just O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago O
and O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
kind O
of O
doubt O
it O
or O
at O
least O
I B-PER:Individual
hope O
not O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
guess O
that O
's O
what O
it O
is O
. O

Mike B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
poisoned O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
just O
fr O
- O
frail O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
'd O
been O
uh O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
'd O
been O
looking O
frail O
and O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
shaky O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
'd O
been O
looking O
h O
- O
like O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
shaking O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
seeming O
frail O
. O

For O
some O
time O
when O
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
see O
him B-PER:Individual
in O
public O
, O
uh O
, O

Mike B-PER:Individual
presentation O
-- O
so O
forth O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
whatever O
it O
was O
, O
it O
got O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
just O
caught O
up O
with O
him B-PER:Individual
and O
and O
he B-PER:Individual
reached O
the O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
the O
end O
of O
his B-PER:Individual
time O
. O

So O
, O
that O
's O
about O
it O
on O
that O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
. O

Well O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
now O
that O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
died O
-- O
it O
'll O
be O
, O
uh O
, O
or O
it O
it O
should O
be O
a O
change O
for O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
~ I-ORG:Non-Governmental
PLO I-ORG:Non-Governmental

Mike B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
yeah O
, O
it O
'll O
be O
change O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
'll O
move O
forward O
any O
better O
-- O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
, O
uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
heard O
our B-ORG:Government
administration I-ORG:Government
thinks O
it O
will O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
a O
block O
to O
the O
peace O
-- O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
not O
only O
his B-PER:Individual
doing O
, O
it O
's O
also O
the O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
the B-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
uh I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
more I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
uh I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
drastic I-PER:Group
elements I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
~ I-PER:Group
PLO I-PER:Group
that B-PER:Group
, O
uh O
, O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
would O
n't O
allow O
him B-PER:Individual
to O
pursue O
peace O

Paul B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
, O
uh O
. O

He B-PER:Individual
he B-PER:Individual
seems O
like O
a B-PER:Individual
guy I-PER:Individual
who B-PER:Individual
is O
much O
more O
comfortable O
-- O
being O
under O
siege O
than O
in O
negotiating O
peace O
settlements O
. O

Mike B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
kind O
of O
damned O
if O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
and O
damned O
if O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
if O
he B-PER:Individual
if O
he B-PER:Individual
made O
peace O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
factions B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
his I-PER:Group
own I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
that B-PER:Group
would O
've O
killed O
him B-PER:Individual
-- O
and O
if O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
make O
peace O
, O
eh O
, O
then O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
considered O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
the O
the B-PER:Individual
warmongering I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
uh I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
man I-PER:Individual
who B-PER:Individual
wo O
n't O
make O
peace O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
. O

So O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
, O
uh O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
could O
n't O
really O
win O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
he B-PER:Individual
could O
make O
peace O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
if O
anyone B-PER:Indeterminate
else I-PER:Indeterminate
can O
, O
either O
. O

Paul B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
that O
's O
the O
big O
question O
, O
if O
someone B-PER:Individual
moderate I-PER:Individual
takes O
over O
and O
they B-GPE:Nation
reach O
a O
settlement O
, O
does O
that O
mean O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
~ I-ORG:Non-Governmental
PLO I-ORG:Non-Governmental
will O
split O
? O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
that O
-- O
that O
could O
be O
just O
-- O
dangerous O
. O

Paul B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
, O
uh O
, O
making O
peace O
with O
half B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
Palestinians I-PER:Group
is O
better O
than O
nothing O
. O

One O
of O
the O
other O
questions O
it O
asked O
us B-PER:Group
was O
, O
did O
we B-PER:Group
think O
our B-PER:Individual
president I-PER:Individual
and O
our B-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
uh I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
you I-PER:Group
know I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
officials I-PER:Group
should O
've O
attended O
his B-PER:Individual
funeral O
. O

What O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
about O
that O
? O

Well O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
remember O
who B-PER:Individual
they B-GPE:Nation
sent O
, O
but O
they B-GPE:Nation
did O
send O
over O
some B-PER:Individual
very I-PER:Individual
-- I-PER:Individual
low I-PER:Individual
level I-PER:Individual
state I-PER:Individual
department I-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual

Mike B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
know O
that O
. O

Paul B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
kind O
of O
embarrassed O
about O
that O
. O

That O
we B-GPE:Nation
did O
or O
d O
- O
that O
we B-GPE:Nation
did O
not O
send O
our B-PER:Group
officials I-PER:Group
. O

Paul B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
-- O
We B-GPE:Nation
-- O
we B-GPE:Nation
did O
, O
but O
i O
- O
it B-PER:Individual
was O
some O
-- O
it B-PER:Individual
was O
a B-PER:Individual
nobody I-PER:Individual
, O
basically O
. O

So O
you B-PER:Individual
were O
embarrassed O
because O
you B-PER:Individual
thought O
they B-GPE:Nation
should O
've O
sent O
someone B-PER:Individual
higher I-PER:Individual
up I-PER:Individual
? O

Paul B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
for O
for O
the O
funeral O
ceremony O
in O
, O
uh O
, O
Egypt B-GPE:Nation
. O
( O
( O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
) O
) O

Mike B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
so O
, O
too O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
they B-GPE:Nation
should O
've O
sent O
someone B-PER:Individual
higher I-PER:Individual
up I-PER:Individual
. O

And O
, O
uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
can O
understand O
that O
they B-GPE:Nation
would O
n't O
want O
to O
send O
anybody B-PER:Individual

Do O
n't O
forget O
this O
was O
the O
this B-PER:Individual
was O
the B-PER:Individual
representative I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
a I-PER:Individual
whole I-PER:Individual
people I-PER:Individual
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
what O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
? O

The O
past O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
their B-PER:Individual
main I-PER:Individual
representative I-PER:Individual
and O
, O
uh O
, O
just O
out O
of O
respect O
for O
the B-GPE:Special
people I-GPE:Special
we B-GPE:Nation
should O
've O
sent O
someone B-PER:Individual

then O
it O
th O

it O
was O
there O

like I-PER:Individual
Yasser I-PER:Individual

, O

Mike B-PER:Individual
he B-PER:Individual
was O
a B-PER:Individual
terrorist I-PER:Individual
. O

In O
in O
the O
sixties O
-- O
in O
the O
mid O

an O
- O
and O
and O

So O
, O
let O
us B-PER:Group
let O
us B-PER:Group
not O
forget O
that O
when O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
was O
-- O
formed O
-- O
and O
they B-GPE:Nation
were O
, O
um O
, O
the O
-- O
the B-GPE:Nation
Israelis I-GPE:Nation
for O
not O
feeling O
-- O
like O
they B-GPE:Nation
had O
a O
legitimate O
-- O
right O
-- O
some B-LOC:Region-General
of I-LOC:Region-General
the I-LOC:Region-General
land I-LOC:Region-General
or O
that B-LOC:Region-General
-- I-LOC:Region-General
land I-LOC:Region-General
was O
n't O
, O
um O
, O
rightfully O
theirs B-GPE:Nation
. O

There O
were O
-- O
two B-ORG:Non-Governmental
very I-ORG:Non-Governmental
strong I-ORG:Non-Governmental
-- I-ORG:Non-Governmental
militant I-ORG:Non-Governmental
groups I-ORG:Non-Governmental
that B-ORG:Non-Governmental
were O
Israeli B-GPE:Nation
and O
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental
-- O
committed O
a O
lot O
of O
terrorist O
acts O
, O

Mike B-PER:Individual
Oh O
, O
the O
yeah O
, O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
Zionists I-ORG:Non-Governmental
. O

So O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
i B-PER:Individual
- O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
uh O
, O
how O
we B-PER:Group
consider O
-- O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
a B-PER:Individual
terrorist I-PER:Individual
, O
we B-PER:Group
also O
should O
consider O
that O
-- O
could O
've O
been O
, O
in O
some O
ways O
, O
a O
reaction O
to O
some O
of O
the O
terrorism O
that O
was O
-- O
initially O
-- O
committed O
by O
the B-GPE:Nation
Israelis I-GPE:Nation
. O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
believe O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
excusing O
-- O
anybody B-PER:Indeterminate
-- O
but O
for O
the O
purpose O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
the O
way O
I B-PER:Individual
see O
it O
is O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O
the O
conversation O
th O
- O
-- O
that O
they B-PER:Group
want O
to O
hear O
, O

Mike B-PER:Individual
y O
- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
got O
to O
kind O
of O
have O
to O
put O
that O
as O
y O
- O
-- O
i O
- O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
like O
-- O
do O
if O
that O
's O
the O
case O
, O
do O
two O
wrongs O
really O
make O
a O
right O
? O

You B-PER:Individual
know O
what O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
? O

But O
if O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
had O
n't O
been O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
if O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
-- O
directly O
-- O
been O
linked O
to O
Hamas B-ORG:Non-Governmental
' O
acts O
, O
uh O
, O
but O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
put O
in O
a O
-- O
pretty O
-- O
sticky O
situation O
having O
to O
negotiate O
-- O
the B-PER:Group
militants I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
Palestine I-PER:Group
-- O
the B-PER:Group
international I-PER:Group
leaders I-PER:Group
-- O
and O
if O
it O
if O
Hara O
- O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
had O
n't O
-- O
somehow O
appeased O
-- O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
Hamas I-ORG:Non-Governmental
groups I-ORG:Non-Governmental
or O
the B-PER:Group
Palestinian I-PER:Group
militants I-PER:Group
, O
then O
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
would O
've O
been O
kicked O
out O
, O
overthrown O
-- O
by O
- O
-- O
by O
the B-PER:Group
Palestinians I-PER:Group
. O

Oh O

how O
it O
works O
over O
there B-GPE:Nation

not O
really O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
-- O
as O
an B-PER:Individual
individual I-PER:Individual
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O

placed I-PER:Individual

Like O
like O
you B-PER:Individual
said O
, O
bringing O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
groups I-ORG:Non-Governmental
together O
but O
the O
reason O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
able O
to O
bring O
them B-ORG:Non-Governmental
together O
is O
because O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
once O
one B-PER:Individual

a O
lot O
of O
controversy O
surrounding O
his B-PER:Individual
illness O
and O

. O

What O

you B-PER:Indeterminate
think O
caused O
his B-PER:Individual
illness O
, O
and O
could O
it O
have O
been O
something O
malicious O
( O
like O
poisoning O
) O
? O

What O
do O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
think O
of O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
's O
policies O
surrounding O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
's O
illness O
and O
death O
? O

Should O
President B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
or O
a B-PER:Individual
senior I-PER:Individual
US I-PER:Individual
official I-PER:Individual
have O
attended O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
's O
funeral O
? O

Should O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
have O
let O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
be O
buried O
in O
Jerusalem B-GPE:Population-Center
? O

Joe B-PER:Individual
Hello O
, O
my B-PER:Individual
name O
is O
Joe O
. O

James B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
James B-PER:Individual
from O
Detroit B-GPE:Population-Center
. O

Joe B-PER:Individual
Uh O
, O
from O
, O
uh O
, O
New B-GPE:State-or-Province
Jersey I-GPE:State-or-Province
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
living O
in O
Atlanta B-GPE:Population-Center
now O
, O
going O
to O
college B-ORG:Educational
. O

So O
, O
uh O
, O
what O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
about O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
? O

Well O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
, O
uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
there O
was O
anything O
malicious O
, O
uh O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
his B-PER:Individual
death O
-- O
uh O
, O
just O
looking O
at O
him B-PER:Individual
these O
last O
, O
uh O
, O
couple O
of O
years O
uh O
, O
it O
seems O
like O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
Alzheimer O
's O
or O
something O
. O

Joe B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
has O
been O
getting O
older O
. O

James B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
because O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
quivering O
at O
the O
mouth O
and O
and O
hands O
were O
shaking O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
would O
imagine O
that O
living O
in O
that B-FAC:Building-Grounds
compound I-FAC:Building-Grounds
could O
n't O
have O
been O
that O
conducive O
to O
his B-PER:Individual
health O
. O

Joe B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
probably O
should O
have O
been O
in O
a B-FAC:Building-Grounds
hospital I-FAC:Building-Grounds
or O
a B-FAC:Building-Grounds
hospice I-FAC:Building-Grounds
or O

Joe B-PER:Individual
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
if O
it O
was O
that O
bad O
. O

Right O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
sure O
that O
they B-GPE:Nation
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
about O
, O
bout O
-- O
the O
uh O
sanitary O
conditions O
there B-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
but O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
just O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
could O
have O
been O
, O
uh O
, O
conducive O
to O
his B-PER:Individual
health O
. O

And O
as O
far O
as O
, O
uh O
, O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
, O
uh O
, O
allowing O
-- O
him B-PER:Individual
to O
be O
buried O
-- O
uh O
, O
in O
Jerusalem B-GPE:Population-Center

James B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
it O
, O
it O
's O
acceptable O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
it O
was O
feasible O
. O

James B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
given O
the O
circumstance O
in O
that B-GPE:Population-Center
area I-GPE:Population-Center
right O
now O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
even O
know O
if O
they B-GPE:Nation
would O
have O
been O
able O
to O
pull O
it O
off O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
? O

Joe B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
uh O
, O
so O
he B-PER:Individual
, O
in O
fact O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O

Joe B-PER:Individual
so O
, O
um O
-- O
no O
, O
so O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
buried O
in O
Jerusalem B-GPE:Population-Center
. O

No O
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
buried O
him B-PER:Individual
-- O
uh O
, O
inside O
that B-FAC:Building-Grounds
compound I-FAC:Building-Grounds
. O

James B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
buried O
him B-PER:Individual
inside O
that B-FAC:Building-Grounds
compound I-FAC:Building-Grounds
. O

But O
like O
you B-PER:Individual
say O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
personally O
-- O
uh O
-- O
would O
n't O
have O
seen O
a O
problem O
with O
it O
, O
but O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
just O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
was O
feasible O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
that O
they B-GPE:Nation
would O
have O
been O
-- O
uh O
, O
secure O
enough O
to O
really O
do O
it O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
either B-GPE:Nation
side I-GPE:Nation
would O
have O
really O
-- O
let O
it O
happen O
-- O
and O
-- O
and O
as O
far O
as O
a B-PER:Individual
senior I-PER:Individual
U.S. I-PER:Individual
official I-PER:Individual
going O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
that O
would O
have O
been O
necessary O
either O
. O

Um O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
know O
President B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
should O
n't O
have O
went O
-- O
and O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
going O
. O

Joe B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
kind O
of O
feel O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
kind O
of O
feel O
another O
way O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
a B-PER:Individual
senior I-PER:Individual
U.S. I-PER:Individual
service I-PER:Individual
in O
there O
, O
should O
have O
been O
there O
, O
because O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
, O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
's O
been O
-- O
been O
the O
one O
coming O
to O
all O
these O
peace O
talks O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
with O
President B-PER:Individual
Clinton I-PER:Individual
and O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
other O

Joe B-PER:Individual
other O
um O
-- O
litigations O
towards O
that O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
we B-GPE:Nation
could O
have O
just O
showed O
our B-GPE:Nation
face O
and O
said O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
yeah O
, O
we B-GPE:Nation
do O
recognize O
this B-PER:Individual
man I-PER:Individual
. O

Well O
it O
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
sent O
someone B-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
who B-PER:Individual
it B-PER:Individual
was O
-- O
( O
( O
It B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
) O
) O

It B-PER:Individual
probably O
, O
it B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
anybody B-PER:Individual
important I-PER:Individual
. O

It B-PER:Individual
was O
just O
like O
a O

James B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
it B-PER:Individual
was O
an B-PER:Individual
under I-PER:Individual
secretary I-PER:Individual
, O
there O
's O
no O
doubt O
about O
it O
. O

James B-PER:Individual
there O
was O
no B-PER:Individual
senior I-PER:Individual
U.S. I-PER:Individual
official I-PER:Individual
there O
. O

There O
's O
there O
's O
no O
question O
about O
that O
. O

James B-PER:Individual
But O
, O
uh O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
uh O
, O
Bush B-PER:Individual
's O
policy O
-- O
towards O
, O
uh O
, O
Yasser B-PER:Individual
Arafat I-PER:Individual
has O
been O
hands O
off O

James B-PER:Individual
from O
from O
the O
beginning O
cause O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
he B-PER:Individual
ever O
even O
met O
with O
him B-PER:Individual
. O

Joe B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

Joe B-PER:Individual
Bush B-PER:Individual
is O
kind O
of O
like O
, O
staying O
away O
from O
the O
whole O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
-- O
Palestinian B-GPE:Special

Now O
on O
his B-PER:Individual
part O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
was O
a O
mistake O
. O

James B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
got O
to O
engage O
people B-PER:Group
in O
some O
type O
of O
dialogue O

Joe B-PER:Individual
to O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
the O
talk O
, O
the O
peace O
talks O
should O
have O
continued O
-- O
after O
Clinton B-ORG:Government
's I-ORG:Government
administration I-ORG:Government
left O
. O

Joe B-PER:Individual
Cause O
at O
the O
cause O
at O
the O
end O
Clinton B-PER:Individual
was O
doing O
all O
this O
peace O
talk O
with O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
and O
, O
um O

Joe B-PER:Individual
( O
( O
forget O
) O
) O
the B-PER:Individual
um I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
prime I-PER:Individual
minister I-PER:Individual
in I-PER:Individual
Israel I-PER:Individual
, O
but O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
talking O
to O
him B-PER:Individual
. O

They B-PER:Group
were O
doing O
all O
these O
talks O
in O
Camp B-FAC:Building-Grounds
David I-FAC:Building-Grounds
and O
and O
it O
should O
have O
just O
continued O
when O
Br O
- O
Bush B-PER:Individual
came O
into O
office O
. O

Like O
I B-PER:Individual
said O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
was O
one O
of O
Bush B-PER:Individual
's O
biggest O
mistakes O
, O

James B-PER:Individual
not O
continuing O
-- O
the O
talks O
. O

Because O
Clinton B-PER:Individual
had O
came O
so O
very O
close O

James B-PER:Individual
to O
to O
maybe O
getting O
some O
type O
of O
agreement O

James B-PER:Individual
but O
, O
uh O
, O
Bush B-PER:Individual
just O
took O
a O
hands O
off O
approach O
. O

He B-PER:Individual
just O
-- O
kind O
of O
took O
a O
hands O
off O
approach O
. O

And O
now O
the O
situation O
in O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
Jerusalem B-GPE:Population-Center
and O
the B-GPE:GPE-Cluster
West I-GPE:GPE-Cluster
Bank I-GPE:GPE-Cluster
is O
just O
-- O
escalated O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
too O
-- O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
's O
-- O
position O
toward O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
-- O
in O
terms O
of O
keeping O
him B-PER:Individual
sort O
of O
like O
-- O
uh O
-- O
surrounded O
in O
that B-FAC:Building-Grounds
compound I-FAC:Building-Grounds
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
that O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
because O
that O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
ca O
n't O
pick O
a B-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
for O
a B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
. O

Whether O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
like O
them B-PER:Group
or O
not O
-- O
people B-PER:Group
get O
to O
choose O
who B-PER:Individual
they B-PER:Group
want O
to O
follow O
, O

James B-PER:Individual
and O
the B-GPE:Special
Palestinians I-GPE:Special
had O
made O
it O
clear O
-- O
that O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
was O
their B-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
. O

So O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
they B-GPE:Nation
, O
we B-GPE:Nation
should O
have O
found O
a O
way O
-- O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
should O
have O
found O
a O
way O
-- O
to O
-- O
keep O
some O
type O
of O
dialogue O
-- O
going O
along O
. O

Cause O
uh O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
look O
at O
what O
's O
going O
on O
now O
. O

James B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
their B-GPE:Nation
policy O
toward O
him B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
get O
them B-GPE:Nation
anything O
. O

And O
then O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
got O
suicide O
bombing O
on O
the B-GPE:Nation
one I-GPE:Nation
side I-GPE:Nation
, O
and O
then O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
got O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
it O
's O
like O
one O
day O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
'll O
he O
- O
a B-WEA:Exploding
bomb I-WEA:Exploding
will O
go O
off O
, O
the O
next O
day O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
will O
do O
and O
air O
strike O
and O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
it O
's O
like O
going O
around O
in O
a O
circle O
. O

It O
's O
like O
going O
around O
in O
a O
circle O
. O

It O
's O
really O
a O
bad O
situation O
. O

It O
is O
, O
and O
it O
's O
, O
it O
's O
been O
so O
long O
-- O
going O
on O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O

What O
I B-PER:Individual
really O
want O
to O
do O
is O

somebody B-PER:Individual
else I-PER:Individual
enjoy O
it O
and O
the B-PER:Group
little I-PER:Group
kids I-PER:Group
enjoy O
it O
. O

So O
- O
-- O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
parties O
with O
family B-PER:Group
-- O
and O
friends B-PER:Group
. O

Jane B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
where O
- O
we B-PER:Group
're O
in O
between O
which B-PER:Group
family I-PER:Group
we B-PER:Group
're O
going O
to O
see O
and O
when O
and O
how O
and O
get O
all O
that O
worked O
out O
. O

Ed B-PER:Individual
so O
whoev O
- O
yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
seen O
them B-PER:Group
- O
-- O
just O
not O
the O
gifts O
it O
comes O
down O
to O
the O
food O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
- O
one O
of O
these O
choices O
is O
meat O
cooking O
. O

We B-PER:Group
'll O
have O
to O
put O
that O
towards O
the O
end. O

Ed B-PER:Individual
my B-PER:Group
family I-PER:Group
's O
, O
uh O
, O
parents B-PER:Group
are O
deceased O
and O
most B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
( I-PER:Group
( I-PER:Group
them I-PER:Group
) O
) O
is O
, O
uh O
, O
passed O
my B-PER:Group
brothers I-PER:Group
all O
over O
, O
so O
her B-PER:Group
family I-PER:Group
's O
still O
younger O
-- O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
just O
the B-PER:Group
odd I-PER:Group
sides I-PER:Group
. O

She B-PER:Individual
's O
the B-PER:Individual
oldest I-PER:Individual
and O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
the B-PER:Individual
youngest I-PER:Individual
, O
so O
she B-PER:Individual
's O
got O
younger O
which O
-- O
keeps O
the O
thing O
going O
, O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
- O
-- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
my B-PER:Individual
view O
is O
-- O
( O
( O
stay O
) O
) O
with O
the B-PER:Group
family I-PER:Group
go O
visit O
the B-PER:Group
family I-PER:Group
. O

So O
-- O
keep O
it O
together O
through O
thick O
and O
thin O
and O
-- O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thanksgiving O
we B-PER:Group
go O
up O
there B-LOC:Region-General
and O
we B-PER:Group
celebrate O
. O

And O
then O
there O
's O
little O
parties O
. O

Big O
- O
uh O
, O
her B-PER:Individual
sister I-PER:Individual
does O
a O
big O
family O
party O
-- O
but O
try O
to O
keep O
that O
same O

Ed B-PER:Individual
local B-PER:Group
family I-PER:Group
coming O
together O
. O

It O
's O
amazing O
how O
they B-PER:Group
can O
get O
into O
little O
squabbles O
and O
who B-PER:Indeterminate
does O
n't O
show O
up O

They B-PER:Group
used O
to O
always O
really O
all O
get O
together O
. O

but O
his B-PER:Group
parents I-PER:Group
uh O
they B-PER:Group
actually O
live O
next O
door O
to O
us B-PER:Group
. O

but O
they B-PER:Group
're O
starting O
to O
get O
up O
in O
the O
years O
, O
so O
they B-PER:Group
're O
not O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
hosting O
the O
big O
parties O
, O
so O
it O
's O
funny O
how O
now O
people B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
all O
bother O
to O
come O

Jane B-PER:Individual
and O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
kind O
of O
wonder O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
in O
the O
next O
couple O
of O
years O
what O
's O
all O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

Are O
they B-PER:Group
all O
going O
to O
see O
each B-PER:Group
other I-PER:Group
. O

Yeah O
, O
no O
that O
's O
- O
that O
's O
exactly O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
've O
already O
seen O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
( O
( O
in O
) O
) O
my B-PER:Group
parents I-PER:Group
( O
( O
' O
bed O
) O
) O
until O
they B-PER:Group
( O
( O
got O
) O
) O
less O
and O
less O
that O
the B-PER:Group
brothers I-PER:Group
got O
together O
-- O
and O
then O
now O
when O
there O
's O
an O
event O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
try O
to O
do O
it O
. O

At O
Christmas O
it O
's O
just O
impossible O
because O
we B-PER:Group
leave O
-- O
two O
days O
after O
Christmas O

Ed B-PER:Individual
to O
go O
out O
of O
the B-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation
as O
part O
of O
our B-PER:Group
New O
Year O
's O

So O
, O
for O
us B-PER:Group
it O
's O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
got O
to O
be O
a O
quick O
trip O
up O

Ed B-PER:Individual
to O
her B-PER:Group
family I-PER:Group
and O
then O
back O
where O
we B-PER:Group
- O
-- O
we B-PER:Group
've O
been O
invited O
to O
be O
down O
in O

If O
a B-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
is O
not O
- O
even O
though O
it O
's O
cold O
up O
in O
the B-LOC:Region-General
Northeast I-LOC:Region-General
, O
it O
's O
a O
family B-PER:Group
tradition O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
should O
do O
it O
-- O
and O
less O
for O
the O
gifts O
and O
more O
for O

Jane B-PER:Individual
Well O
, O
we B-PER:Group
did O
- O
-- O
- O
for O
the B-PER:Group
kids I-PER:Group
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
we B-PER:Group
made O
it O
pretty O
cl O
- O

Ed B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
's O
great O
. O

Jane B-PER:Individual
- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
did O
n't O
have O
all O
the O
hassle O
of O
running O
around O
and O
being O
crazy O
and O
just O
kind O
of O
spent O
time O
together O

Ed B-PER:Individual
And O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
's O
very O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
if O
- O

Jane B-PER:Individual
and O
it O
was O
really O
pretty O
nice O
. O

Ed B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
we B-PER:Group
have O
n't O
- O
-- O
yeah O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
-- O
e O
- O

e O
- O
eventually O
that O
may O
happen O
, O
the O
way O
we B-PER:Group
're O
going O
with O
, O
uh O
, O

Ed B-PER:Individual
my B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
and O
I B-PER:Individual
with O
her B-PER:Individual

Not O
as O
a O
negative O
but O
as O
a O
- O

Ed B-PER:Individual
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
we B-PER:Group
do O
a O
lot O
of O
traveling O
so O
that O
's O
going O
to O
be O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
's O
going O
to O
come O
up O
. O

But O
- O
-- O
but O
for O
now O
we B-PER:Group
're O
still O
trying O
to O
do O
- O

Ed B-PER:Individual
as O
long O
as O
the B-PER:Individual
mother I-PER:Individual
's O
around O
, O
we B-PER:Group
'll O
still O
do O
Christmas O
and O
act O
as O
- O

Ed B-PER:Individual
she B-PER:Individual
is O
not O
really O
old O
, O
but O
she B-PER:Individual
's O
getting O
older O
, O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
's O
one O
reason O
to O
stay O
together O

Ed B-PER:Individual
and O
also O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
i O
- O
is O

Ed B-PER:Individual
eh O
, O
we B-PER:Group
- O
we B-PER:Group
kind O
of O
-- O
infused O
a O
little O
family B-PER:Group
party O
that O
her B-PER:Individual
sister I-PER:Individual
has O
so O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
if O
we B-PER:Group
were O
to O
go O
away O
both O
of O
those O
might O
fall O
off O
a O
little O
bit O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
but O
one O
year O
and O
then O
all O
of O
the O
sudden O
everybody B-PER:Group
's O

Ed B-PER:Individual
not O
coming O
to O
it O
anymore O
and O
it O
's O
like O
a O
- O

That O
's O
the O
way O
it O
is O
. O

Ed B-PER:Individual
Yeah O
, O
but O
not O
because O
- O

Ed B-PER:Individual
it O
is O
- O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
- O
I B-PER:Individual
enjoy O
the B-PER:Group
-- I-PER:Group
smiling I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
and O
the O
festive O
- O
-- O
festive O
nature O
and O
-- O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
does O
get O
a O
little O
commercialized O
. O

( O
( O
It O
's O
not O
that O
the O
- O
) O
) O
-- O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
can O
ignore O
that O
part O
of O
it O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
. O

The O
holiday O
season O
is O
right O
around O
the O
corner O
. O

Who B-PER:Indeterminate
do O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
like O
to O
celebrate O

or O
family B-PER:Group
members I-PER:Group
? O

does O
make O
it O
special O
? O

Well O

I B-PER:Individual
guess O
they B-PER:Group

it O
's O
not O

not O
special O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
because O
they B-PER:Group
do O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
special O
would O
make O
it O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
only O
see O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
once O
a O
year O
. O

It O
's O
just O
not O

it O
's O
just O
not O
special O
if O
I B-PER:Individual
see O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
every O
other O
month O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
it O
's O
just O
not O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
not O

you B-PER:Indeterminate
might O
- O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
may O
see O

your B-PER:Group
aunts I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
uncles I-PER:Group
and O
all B-PER:Group
your I-PER:Group
cousins I-PER:Group

all O
the O
time O
, O
where O

, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
they B-PER:Group
like O
- O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
particularly O
care O

, O
uh O
, O
it O

- O
it O
was O
a O
good O
day O
. O

Uh O
, O
but O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
, O
we B-PER:Group
- O
we B-PER:Group
-- O
spend O
all O
day O
together O
. O

a O
couple O
of O
hours O

go O
home B-FAC:Building-Grounds
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
go O
and O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
stay O
twelve O
hours O
-- O
because O
most B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
my I-PER:Group
relatives I-PER:Group
live O
within O
thirty O
minutes O
of O
each B-PER:Group
other I-PER:Group

just O
to O
go O
to O
someone B-FAC:Building-Grounds

house I-FAC:Building-Grounds
. O

Well O

sounds O
a O
lot O
like O
my B-PER:Individual
mom I-PER:Individual
's O
side O
of O
the B-PER:Group
family I-PER:Group
because O
they B-PER:Group
're O

Ryan B-PER:Individual
except O
for O

, O
us B-PER:Group
. O

you B-PER:Individual

be O
with O
everyone B-PER:Group
else I-PER:Group
or O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
like O
it O
-- O

. O

Ryan B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual

how O
my B-PER:Group
other I-PER:Group
cousins I-PER:Group
are O
doing O
and O
-- O
she B-PER:Individual
hardly O
knows O
because O
she B-PER:Individual
has O
- O
hardly O
sees O
them B-PER:Group
every O
day O
. O

So O
I B-PER:Individual

n't O

big O
difference O
. O

doing O
what O
they B-ORG:Government
did O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
they B-ORG:Government
had O
a O
short O
window O
of O
opportunity O

In O
January O
the B-GPE:Nation

nearly O
a O

under O
a O
1994 O
agreement O
with O
the B-ORG:Government
Clinton I-ORG:Government
administration I-ORG:Government
. O

But O
according O
to O
U.S. B-PER:Group
officials I-PER:Group
, O
it O
now O
appears O
that O
North B-PER:Group
Korean I-PER:Group
engineers I-PER:Group
ran O
into O
technical O
problems O
in O
restarting O
the B-FAC:Plant
facilities I-FAC:Plant
. O

While O
intelligence B-PER:Group
officials I-PER:Group
have O
reached O
no O
consensus O
, O
they B-PER:Group
told O
allies B-GPE:Nation
last O
week O
that O
in O
the O
worst O
case O
, O
only O
a O
few O
hundred O
of O
the O
8,000 O
rods O
had O
been O
converted O
into O
plutonium O
. O

It O
would O
take O
1,000 O
to O
1,500 O
rods O
to O
make O
enough O
plutonium O
for O
a B-WEA:Nuclear
weapon I-WEA:Nuclear
, O
experts B-PER:Group
say O
.O O

`` O
What O
we B-PER:Group
are O
told O
is O
that O
it O
would O
take O
perhaps O
six O
months O
after O
that O
to O
produce O
a B-WEA:Nuclear
miniaturized I-WEA:Nuclear
warhead I-WEA:Nuclear

put O
it B-WEA:Nuclear
into O
one B-WEA:Projectile

, O
'' O
said O
one B-PER:Individual
senior I-PER:Individual
official I-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
has I-PER:Individual
recently I-PER:Individual
reviewed I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual

`` O
But O
after O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
, O
who B-PER:Indeterminate
knows O
how O
good O
those O

After O
the O

about O

in I-WEA:Underspecified
Iraq I-WEA:Underspecified
, I-WEA:Underspecified
which I-WEA:Underspecified

not I-WEA:Underspecified
been I-WEA:Underspecified
found I-WEA:Underspecified
so I-WEA:Underspecified
far I-WEA:Underspecified
, O
skepticism O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
U.S. B-GPE:Nation
intelligence O
is O
widespread O
. O

And O
in O
the O
case O
of O
North B-GPE:Nation
Korea I-GPE:Nation
, O
as O
in O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
, O
the O
immediacy O
of O
the O
threat O
depends O
on O
whose B-PER:Indeterminate
analysis O
seems O
most O
compelling O
. O

So O
far O
, O
U.S. B-GPE:Nation
intelligence O
has O
picked O
up O
almost O
no O
sign O
of O
the O
telltale O
krypton O
gas O
that O
is O
released O
into O
the O
atmosphere O
when O
nuclear O
fuel O

are O
converted O
into O
weapons B-WEA:Nuclear
- O
grade O
plutonium O
. O

This O
has O
led O
some B-PER:Group
analysts I-PER:Group
to O
argue O
that O
the B-GPE:Nation
North I-GPE:Nation
Koreans I-GPE:Nation
may O
be O
farther O
from O
producing O
a B-WEA:Nuclear
weapon I-WEA:Nuclear
than O
feared O
a O
few O
months O

But O
others B-PER:Group
note O
that O

it O

even O
whether O

Reeve O
could O
have O
died O
from O
an O
allergic O
reaction O

Reeve O
had O
a O
rare O
disorder O
called O
Mastocytosis O
. O

Drug O
sensitivities O
are O
one O
of O
the O
difficulties O
of O
that O
disorder O
. O

Since O
they B-PER:Group
knew O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
it O
, O
that O
's O
probably O
why O
she B-PER:Individual
's O
not O
questioning O
this O
issue O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
often O
wondered O
how O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
doing O
with O
all O
the O
meds O
because O
of O
his B-PER:Individual
illness O
, O
which O
developed O
before O
his B-PER:Individual
paralyzing O
accident O
. O

It O
's O
actually O
a O
testament O
to O
his O
stamina O
and O
his B-PER:Group
doctors I-PER:Group
that O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
able O
to O
survive O
as O
long O
as O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
with O
this O
disorder O
complicating O
his O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
sure O
about O
this O
disagreement O
you B-PER:Individual
are O
speaking O
of O
between O
her B-PER:Individual
version O
and O
the B-PER:Group
doctors I-PER:Group
version O
of O
his B-PER:Individual
cause O
of O
death O
. O

Maybe O
the O
Dr. O

had O
hypothesized O
possibilities O
at O
the O
time O
of O
death O
and O
in O
the O
months O
since O
then O
, O
they B-PER:Group
may O
thought O
of O
other O

I O
do O
n't O

I B-PER:Individual
know O
about O

and O
meds O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
've O
been O
a B-PER:Individual
nurse I-PER:Individual
for O
20 O
years O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
get O
a O
little O
defensive O
myself B-PER:Individual
when O
a O
hear O
a B-PER:Individual
layperson I-PER:Individual
( O
although O
she B-PER:Individual
probably O
had O
more O
knowledge O
than O
most B-PER:Group
about O
her B-PER:Individual
husband I-PER:Individual
's O
diagnosis O

treatment O
) O
talking O
like O
an B-PER:Individual
expert I-PER:Individual
on O
TV O
without O
knowing O
all O
the O
details O

But O
as O
I O
said O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
saw O
the O

did O
not O
get O
that O
feeling O

that O
she B-PER:Individual

. O

She B-PER:Individual
also O
was O
not O
coming O
off O

it O

This O
part O
of O

was O
very O

informal O
feeling O
, O
more O
like O

I B-PER:Individual

, O
maybe O
it O
was O
this O
, O
it O
could O
have O
been O
that O

It O
was O
more O
that O
she B-PER:Individual
knew O
many B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
cared O
about O
her B-PER:Individual
husband I-PER:Individual
and O
wanted O
to O

Re O
: O
The O
old O
wedding O
problem O

I B-PER:Individual
really O
think O
it O
's O
time O
for O
the B-ORG:Religious
church I-ORG:Religious
to O
admit O
that O
a O
civil O
ceremony O
followed O
by O
a O
temple B-FAC:Building-Grounds
sealing O
reaches O
the O
same O
goal O
, O
often O
in O
a O
more O
loving O
way O
, O
than O
insisting O
that O
only O
the O
sealing O
is O
worth O
doing O
. O

A O
change O
of O
that O
sort O
would O
be O
very O
simple O
to O
implement O
, O
and O
most B-PER:Group
church I-PER:Group
members I-PER:Group
would O
like O
it O
better O
than O
allowing O
non B-PER:Group
-LDS I-PER:Group
family I-PER:Group
members I-PER:Group
into O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
temple I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
which O
would O
actually O
be O
my B-PER:Individual
preference O
. O

There O
's O
been O
a O
thread O
recently O
in O
one O
of O
the O
exMo O
fora O
about O
a B-PER:Individual
woman I-PER:Individual
whose I-PER:Individual
bishop I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
she I-PER:Individual
had I-PER:Individual
been I-PER:Individual
planning I-PER:Individual
to I-PER:Individual
have I-PER:Individual
marry I-PER:Individual
her I-PER:Individual
, O
was O
going O
out O
of O
town B-GPE:Population-Center
, O
so O
she B-PER:Individual
asked O
the O
stake O
president O
, O
who B-PER:Individual
she B-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
know O
well O
. O

He B-PER:Individual
insisted O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
needed O
to O
make O
the O
point O
, O
as O
part O
of O
performing O
the O
ceremony O
, O
that O
she B-PER:Individual
really O
needed O
to O
be O
married O
in O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
temple I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
even O
though O
her B-PER:Individual
fiance I-PER:Individual
was O
not O
LDS O
. O

She B-PER:Individual
ultimately O
declined O
his B-PER:Individual
services O
. O

How O
to O
get O
the O
message O
across O
to O
young B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
that O
considering O
the O
feelings O
of O
their B-PER:Group
family I-PER:Group
is O
just O
as O
important O
as O
being O
sealed O
for O
time O
and O
all O
eternity O
? O

It O
would O
have O
to O
be O
some O
sort O
of O
grassroots O
movement O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
, O
since O
it O
's O
not O
likely O
to O
come O
through O
official O
, O
correlated O
channels O
. O

A O
dog O
can O
never O
tell O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
what O
she O
knows O
from O
the O
smells O
of O
the B-LOC:Celestial
world I-LOC:Celestial
, O
but O
you B-PER:Indeterminate

that O

nothing O

Re O

* O
shrugs O

I B-PER:Individual
chose O
to O
have O
a O
civil O
ceremony O
largely O
because O
my B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
and O
I B-PER:Individual
were O
both B-PER:Group
converts B-PER:Group
and O
a O
temple B-FAC:Building-Grounds

would O
have O
excluded O
both B-PER:Group
families I-PER:Group
completely O
. O

From O
a O
family B-PER:Group
standpoint O
it O
sounded O
liek O
a O
good O
decision O
, O
harmony O
and O
all O
that O
... O
plus O
the O
temple B-FAC:Building-Grounds
ceremony O
could O
be O
sealed O
a O
year O
later O
. O

Unfortunately O
we B-PER:Group
started O
off O
on O
the O
wrong O
foot O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
reasons O
and O
the O
marriage O
did O
n't O
last O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
ca O
n't O
help O
but O
wonder O
if O
perhaps O
we B-PER:Group
did O
ourselves B-PER:Group
a O
diservice O
by O
not O
getting O
sealedi O
ntially O
, O
and O
making O
our B-PER:Group
marriage O
a O
gospel O
focused O
one O
. O

It O
's O
a O
tough O
decision O
to O
make O
and O
despite O
the O
feeling O
I B-PER:Individual
myself B-PER:Individual
caved O
I B-PER:Individual
feel O
people B-PER:Group
should O
be O
understanding O
of O
the O
rationale O
. O

For O
my B-PER:Individual
part O
if O
we B-PER:Group
had O
been O
sealed O
intially O
there O
simply O
would O
n't O
have O
been O
ANYONE B-PER:Indeterminate
there O
and O
both B-PER:Group
our I-PER:Group
families I-PER:Group
had O
harsh O
feeligns O
about O
the B-ORG:Religious
church I-ORG:Religious
as O
is O
, O
and O
a O
sealign O
would O
have O
only O
created O
more O

For O
my B-PER:Individual

though O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
we B-PER:Group
started O
the O

I B-PER:Individual

we B-PER:Group

just O

they B-PER:Group
all O

there O

he B-PER:Individual

it O

And O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
take O
lots O

I B-PER:Individual
really O
have O

changed O
very O
much O

I I-PER:Individual
was I-PER:Individual
before I-PER:Individual

Although O
, O
the O
dog O

is O
really O
post O
divorce O

Lots O
and O
lots O

Sometimes O
I B-PER:Individual
look O
at O
the O
old O
photos O
, O
before O

We B-PER:Group
smiled O
together O
, O
laughed O

I B-PER:Individual

one B-PER:Individual

the I-PER:Individual
first I-PER:Individual
digital I-PER:Individual

and O
I B-PER:Individual
have O
too O
many O

from O
my B-PER:Individual

Sometimes O
I B-PER:Individual
feel O
like O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
racing O
to O
create O
enough O
photos O
of O
my B-PER:Individual
new O

to O
outweigh O
the O
long O
history O
of O
my B-PER:Individual
first O

That O
's O
going O
to O
take O
awhile O
... O

Luckily O
, O
we B-PER:Group
flawed B-PER:Group
human I-PER:Group
beings I-PER:Group
live O
long O

and O
digital O

take O
lots O

lots O

! O

If O
my B-PER:Individual
exwife I-PER:Individual
does O
n't O
dump O
B B-PER:Individual
, O
maybe O
they B-PER:Group
'll O
wind O
up O
staying O
together O
, O
maybe O
even O
getting O
married O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
would O
be O
nice O
. O

And O
they B-PER:Group
too O
will O
begin O
the O
process O
of O
rebuilding O
their B-PER:Group
" O
together O
" O
lives O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
assuming O
there O
is O
some O
humanity O
beneath O
my B-PER:Individual
exwife I-PER:Individual
's O
narcicistic O
shell O
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
believe O
there O
is O
. O

B B-PER:Individual
seems O
like O
a B-PER:Individual
decent I-PER:Individual
enough I-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
too O
. O

So O
, O
B B-PER:Individual
and O
my B-PER:Individual
ex I-PER:Individual
will O
be O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
doing O
. O

Anyway O
, O
all O
of O
this O
gets O
me B-PER:Individual
back O
to O
my B-PER:Individual
original O
point O
. O

Divorce O
seems O
really O
really O
stupid O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
that O
beneath O
it O
all O
, O
we B-PER:Group
all O
want O
the O
same O
things O
. O

Love O
, O
companionship O
, O
and O
a B-PER:Individual
partner I-PER:Individual
for I-PER:Individual
our I-PER:Individual
life I-PER:Individual
's I-PER:Individual

. O

None O
of O
this O
makes O

But O
I B-PER:Individual

Gateway B-ORG:Commercial
brought O
by O
some B-PER:Group
Philadelphia I-PER:Group
lawyers I-PER:Group
a O
number O
of O
years O

. O

Gateway B-ORG:Commercial
advertised O
and O
stickered O
many O
of O
its B-ORG:Commercial
486 O

as O
" O
Pentium O

" O
, O
meaning O
that O
a O
special O
Type O
3 O
ZIF O

Pentium O

could O
be O
installed O

run O
. O

Micronics B-ORG:Commercial
designed O
the O

used O
by O
Gateway B-ORG:Commercial
, O
and O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
design O
was O
a O
prototype O
Pentium O
OverDrive O
with O
an O
internal O
write O
- O
through O
cache O
, O
a O
more O
conservative O
cache O
design O
. O

Then O
Intel B-ORG:Commercial
changed O
the O
Pentium O
OverDrive O
, O
and O
the O
final O
version O
had O
a O
write O
- O
BACK O

. O

When O
installed O
in O
a O
Gateway B-ORG:Commercial

, O
the O

ran O
slower O

maybe O

refused O

So O
the B-PER:Group

sued O
Gateway B-ORG:Commercial

and O
the O
settlement O
approved O
by O
the B-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual

gleefully O
cashed O

Intel B-ORG:Commercial
eventually O

a O
little O

installed O
between O
the O

the O

The O
sole O
purpose O
of O
the O
interposer O
was O
to O
raise O
a O
signal O
on O
the O
CPU O
to O
force O
it O

Needless O

, O
this O
was O
the O

McGill B-PER:Individual
says O
the O
Law O
says O
so O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
thought O
this O
law O
was O
fairly O
well O
known O
, O
as O
long O
as O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
keys O
on O
you B-PER:Individual
are O
ok O

Surely O
everyone B-PER:Group
has O
heard O
the O
trick O
of O
rolling O
the O
front O
wheel O
over O
the O
keys O
. O

Chances O
are O
sleeping O
it O
off O
in O
the B-VEH:Land
car I-VEH:Land
wo O
n't O
be O
terribly O
effective O
because O
you B-PER:Individual

most O

McGill B-PER:Individual
says O
the O
Law O
says O
so O
. O

In O
Q B-GPE:Population-Center
he O
's O
in O
charge O
of O
the B-VEH:Land
car I-VEH:Land
from O
the O
moment O
he B-PER:Individual
attempts O
to O
put O
the O
key O
in O
the O
door O
lock O
. O

If O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
asleep O
in O
the B-VEH:Subarea-Vehicle
back I-VEH:Subarea-Vehicle
seat I-VEH:Subarea-Vehicle
with O
the O
keys O
in O
his B-PER:Individual
possession O
then O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
the O
person O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
car O
. O

The O
offence O
is O
being O
drunk O
in O
charge O
of O
a B-VEH:Underspecified
vehicle I-VEH:Underspecified
-- O
as O
distinct O
from O
being O
drunk O
while O
operating O
a B-VEH:Underspecified
vehicle I-VEH:Underspecified
( O
which O
is O
a O
separate O
offence O
) O
. O

The O
way O
to O
avoid O
being O
charged O
is O
to O
give O
the O
keys O
to O
someone B-PER:Individual
else I-PER:Individual
to O
unlock O
the O
door O
and O
have O
them O
hang O
on O
to O
the O
keys O
until O
you O
're O
below O
.05 O
. O

The O
standard O
ruse O
is O
to O
throw O
the O
keys O
under O
the B-VEH:Land
car I-VEH:Land
after O
you B-PER:Individual
've O
unlocked O
the O
door O
( O
which O
you B-PER:Individual
can O
later O
claim O
was O
unlocked O
by O
a O
person O
unknown O
) O
. O

In O
this O
case O
the B-PER:Individual
offender I-PER:Individual
escaped O
conviction O
first O
time O
around O
because O
it O
was O
accepted O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
attempted O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
keys O
, O
which O
supposedly O
landed O
in O
his O
lap O
. O

Judge B-PER:Individual
McGill I-PER:Individual
got O
it O
right O
as O
the O
law O
stands O

taking O
charge O
of O
it B-VEH:Land
from O
some O
other O
person O
" O
and O
can O
therefore O
be O
charged O
? O

Sure O
, O
no B-PER:Individual
reasonable I-PER:Individual
cop I-PER:Individual
would O
do O
that O
, O
but O
just O
strictly O
talking O
from O

Or O
does O
the O
fact O
that O
I B-PER:Individual

McGill O
says O
the O
Law O
says O
so O
. O

If O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
a B-WEA:Shooting

in O
his O
pocket O
, O
or O
a B-WEA:Exploding
case I-WEA:Exploding

that O
half O

would O
be O

Same O

pistol I-WEA:Shooting
is O
in O

safe O
and O

So O
long O
as O
you B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
attempt O
to O
access O
either O
any O
charge O
is O
n't O
likely O
to O
stick O
. O

I O
'm O
reminded O
of O
when O
I B-PER:Individual
lived O
in O
another B-GPE:State-or-Province
state I-GPE:State-or-Province
and O
the B-PER:Individual
local I-PER:Individual
cop I-PER:Individual
charged O
the B-PER:Individual
town I-PER:Individual
drunk I-PER:Individual
in O
his B-PER:Individual
driveway O
after O
following O
him O
home O
from O
the O
pub O
. O

The B-PER:Individual
drunk I-PER:Individual
was O
acquitted O
on O
the O
technicality O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
n't O
on O
a O
public O
road O
when O
the O
cop O
arrested O
him B-PER:Individual
. O

Would O
n't O
have O
happened O
under O
Qld B-GPE:Population-Center
law O
-- O
and O
should O
n't O
have O
happened O
anywhere O
else O
. O

So O
whose O
law O
is O
stupid O
? O

Agreed O
, O
and O
not O
likely O
to O
happen O
in O
Q O
. O

You B-PER:Individual

deemed O

On O

of O
his B-PER:Individual

He B-PER:Individual
was O
confused O
, O
because O
of O
the O

but O
was O
not O
aggressive O
or O
threatening O
in O
any O
manner O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
saw O
him B-PER:Individual
each O
day O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
we B-PER:Group
spoke O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
became O
oriented O
and O
was O
perfectly O
fine O
. O

This O
was O
witnessed O
by O
both O
the B-PER:Group
nursing I-PER:Group
staff I-PER:Group
and O
his B-PER:Individual
doctors O
. O

During O
the O
early O
evening O
hours O
of O
his B-PER:Individual
sixth O

day O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
got O
up O
, O

his B-PER:Individual
chest O

out O
and O
managed O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds

and O
across O
four O
lanes O
of O
busy B-VEH:Land

was O
very O
short O

and O
there O
was O
a O
nurse O
and O
orderly O
who B-PER:Group
told O
me B-PER:Individual
" O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
crazy O
and O
just O
walked O
out O
. O
" O

I B-PER:Individual
sat O

and O

. O

He B-PER:Individual
said O
he B-PER:Individual
'd O
asked O

for O
pain O
and O
they B-PER:Group
told O
hime B-PER:Individual
he B-PER:Individual
could O
n't O
have O
anything O
. O

Then O
the B-PER:Individual
orderly I-PER:Individual
was O
apparently O
rude O
to O
him B-PER:Individual
, O
and O
that O
's O
when O
he B-PER:Individual
got O
up O
and O
decided O
to O
come O
home O
. O

A O

time O
later O

officers I-PER:Group
showed O
up O
and O
told O
me B-PER:Individual
they B-PER:Group
had O
to O
take O
him B-PER:Individual
back O
to O

. O

He B-PER:Individual
went O
back O

, O
gave O
them B-PER:Group
no O
problems O
at O

I B-PER:Individual

became O
confused O
or O

, O
and O

Well O
here O
is O
the O
problem O
that O
I B-PER:Individual

many B-PER:Group

be O

If O
North B-GPE:Nation

The B-ORG:Government

now O
we B-PER:Group

we B-GPE:Nation

does O

The O
simple O

this O
: O

" O

In O
fact O

he B-PER:Individual

He B-PER:Individual
lost O
the O

1,750,000 O

This O
shows O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
the O
scale O
of O
the O
fraud O

The O
exit O
polls O
were O
not O
wrong O

Kerry B-PER:Individual
was O
the B-PER:Individual
clear I-PER:Individual
winner I-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
but O
victory O
was O
snatched O
from O
him B-PER:Individual
. I-PER:Individual

The O
200,000 O
+ O
margin O
of O
victory O
for O
Bush B-PER:Individual
made O
this B-GPE:State-or-Province
state I-GPE:State-or-Province
uncontestable O
. O

Everybody B-PER:Group
assumes O
that O
even O
with O
some O
fraud O
, O
Kerry B-PER:Individual
could O
never O
have O
made O
up O
the O
difference O
in O
a O
recount O
. O

But O
Kerry B-PER:Individual
actually O
won O
by O
about O
750,000 O
votes O
. O

The O
numbers O
were O
changed O
by O
a O
computer O
program O
( O
in O
both O
electronic O

The O

For O
additional O
encryption O

the O
numbers O
were O
jumbled O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
sure O
in O
which O
order O
. O

The O
numbers O
replace O
the O

the O
alphabet O

For O
example O
, O
K O
is O
the O
eleventh O
letter O

So O
the O
if O

then O
statement O
goes O
something O
like O
this O
: O

The O
second O
part O
of O
the O
equation O
takes O
the O
total O
number O

cast O

subtracts O
the O

subtracts O

third B-ORG:Non-Governmental

and O
leaves O
the O
rest O
for O
Kerry B-PER:Individual

Sometimes O
the O

would O
also O
reduce O
third B-ORG:Non-Governmental
party I-ORG:Non-Governmental
votes O
and O
award O
them O
to O
Bush B-PER:Individual

And O
even O
where O

he B-PER:Individual

You B-PER:Indeterminate
should O

and O
also O
know O
that O
this O
was O
no O
accident O

The B-PER:Group
Bush I-PER:Group
team I-PER:Group
had O
to O
make O
up O
the O

as O
the O
night O
went O
on O

In O
Ohio B-GPE:State-or-Province
, I-GPE:State-or-Province
computer O
voting O
fraud O
, O
vote O
tossing O
and O
voter O
suppression O
were O
the O
main O
methods O

Vote O
tossing O
was O
simply O
the O
removal O
of O

and O
some O
third B-ORG:Non-Governmental
party I-ORG:Non-Governmental
votes O

In O
some B-LOC:Region-General
areas I-LOC:Region-General

the O
Bush B-PER:Individual
vs. O

votes O
were O
absurd O
. O

Nine O

one O

eight O

two O

Voter B-PER:Group
suppression O
took O
the O
form O

making O
voters B-PER:Group
stand O
in O
four O
hour O
long O
lines O
. O

This O
of O
course O
took O
place O
in O
Democratic B-LOC:Region-General
areas I-LOC:Region-General
. I-LOC:Region-General

The O
simplest O
thing O
to O
do O
was O
to O
have O
too O
few O
voting O
machines O
. O

Sometimes O
that O
's O
all O
it O
takes O
. O

People B-PER:Group
eventually O
lose O
patience O
and O
leave O
without O
casting O
a O

In O
other B-GPE:State-or-Province
states I-GPE:State-or-Province
such I-GPE:State-or-Province
as I-GPE:State-or-Province

New I-GPE:State-or-Province

, I-GPE:State-or-Province
Kerry B-PER:Individual
's O
leads O
evaporated O
very O
quickly O
once O
the O

shut O
down O

Kerry B-PER:Individual
only O
won O
New B-GPE:State-or-Province

, I-GPE:State-or-Province
but O
barely O
. O

As O
it O
turned O

the O

was O
6 B-Numeric:Percent

Kerry B-PER:Individual
in O
that B-GPE:State-or-Province

and O
not O
enough O
fraudulent O

took O

this O
is O
a O
cop O

out O
response O

the O
reason O
we B-GPE:Nation
are O
so O
worried O
is O
because O
we B-GPE:Nation
are O
on O
a O
higher O
level O
than O
90 B-GPE:Nation
% I-GPE:Nation
of I-GPE:Nation
the I-GPE:Nation

we I-GPE:Nation
do I-GPE:Nation

like I-GPE:Nation
start O
developing O
nuclear B-WEA:Nuclear

although O
so O

, O
iran B-GPE:Nation
has O
shown O
that O
they B-GPE:Nation
are O
* O
not O
* O
producing O
weapons B-WEA:Nuclear

grade O
material O
and O
are O
in O
fact O
using O
their B-GPE:Nation
nuclear O
power O
for O
just O
that O
, O
according O
to O
the O

when O
you B-GPE:Nation

a B-PER:Individual

try O
everything O
he B-PER:Individual
can O
to O
try O
to O
prove O
his B-PER:Individual
case O

maybe O
because O
oil O
is O
a O
much O
bigger O
polluting O
source O
of O
energy O
than O
nuclear O
? O

or O
maybe O
because O
it O

more O

in O

the O

attention O

that O

before O
. O

However O
, O
this O
new O
and O
brighter O
spotlight O
on O
these O

also O
had O
the O
unfortunate O
effect O
of O

the O
collectibility O

value O

As O
such O
, O
during O
the O

many O

The O

resulted O
in O
two O

something O

A O
thicker O

with O

from O
both B-PER:Group

Swenson B-PER:Individual
herself B-PER:Individual
would O
also O
leave O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental

Not O
much O
later O
, O
she B-PER:Individual
began O
publishing O
her B-PER:Individual
own O
magazine O
called O
" O

, O
which O
was O
essentially O
a O
scholarly O
photo O

depicting O
different B-PER:Group
carvers I-PER:Group
and O

each O

Meanwhile O
, O
those B-PER:Group
collectors I-PER:Group
who I-PER:Group
left I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
National I-PER:Group

banded O
together O

the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
American I-ORG:Non-Governmental

Society I-ORG:Non-Governmental
( I-ORG:Non-Governmental
ACS I-ORG:Non-Governmental
) I-ORG:Non-Governmental
, I-ORG:Non-Governmental
whose I-ORG:Non-Governmental
stated I-ORG:Non-Governmental
aims I-ORG:Non-Governmental
of I-ORG:Non-Governmental

preservation I-ORG:Non-Governmental
also I-ORG:Non-Governmental
recognized I-ORG:Non-Governmental

as I-ORG:Non-Governmental
a I-ORG:Non-Governmental
positive I-ORG:Non-Governmental
asset I-ORG:Non-Governmental
towards I-ORG:Non-Governmental
that I-ORG:Non-Governmental
goal I-ORG:Non-Governmental
. O

For O
the O
next O
couple O
of O
decades O
, O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
two I-ORG:Non-Governmental
carousel I-ORG:Non-Governmental
organizations I-ORG:Non-Governmental
would O
co-exist O
, O
each B-ORG:Non-Governmental
attracting O
its B-ORG:Non-Governmental
share O
of O
members B-PER:Group
. O

Some B-PER:Group
would O
actually O
join O
both B-ORG:Non-Governmental
groups I-ORG:Non-Governmental
, O
and O
even O
attend O
both O
of O
their B-ORG:Non-Governmental
annual O
conventions O
. O

During O
the O
mid-1980 O
's O
Walter B-PER:Individual
Louck I-PER:Individual
would O
begin O
publishing O
" O
The O
Carousel O
Trader O
" O
, O
later O
renamed O
" O
The O
Carousel O
News O
& O
Trader O
" O
. O

This O
monthly O
magazine O
would O
cover O
all O
angles O
and O
sides O
of O
the O
story O
of O
the O
carousel O
and O
be O
well O
received O
by O
all O
carousel O
enthusiasts O
. O

About O
a O
decade O
later O
, O
Carousel O
Art O
would O
suddenly O
cease O
publication O
. O

The B-ORG:Non-Governmental
NCA I-ORG:Non-Governmental
would O
continue O
to O
issue O
the O
Roundup O
to O
its B-ORG:Non-Governmental
members O
. O

The O
mid O
to O
late O
1990 O
's O
saw O
the O
passing O
of O
NCA B-PER:Individual
founder I-PER:Individual
Fred I-PER:Individual
Fried I-PER:Individual
, O
and O
also O
that O
of O
Charlotte B-PER:Individual
Dinger I-PER:Individual
, O
both O
who B-PER:Group
represented O
the O
two O
opposite O
points O
of O
view O
in O
the O
carousel O
preservation O
debate O
. O

Coincidentally O
and O
amazingly O
, O
the O
art O
of O
building O
hand O
- O
carved O
carousels O
( O
and O
even O
bandorgans O
) O
has O
been O
revived O
, O
with O
firms B-ORG:Commercial
such I-ORG:Commercial
as I-ORG:Commercial
Carousel I-ORG:Commercial
Works I-ORG:Commercial
and I-ORG:Commercial
Carousel I-ORG:Commercial
Magic I-ORG:Commercial
again O
building O
the O
popular O
rides O
in O
classic O
design O
. O

This O
development O
seems O
to O
have O
greatly O
alleviated O
the O
antique O
marketplace O
pressures O
that O
have O
doomed O
so O
many O
legacy O
wooden O
carousels O
over O
the O
past O
several O
decades O
. O

The O
turn O
of O
the O
new O
millenium O
actually O
witnessesed O
a O
thaw O
in O
the O
relationship O
between O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
National I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Carousel I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Association I-ORG:Non-Governmental
and I-ORG:Non-Governmental
American I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Carousel I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Society I-ORG:Non-Governmental
, O
as O
newer B-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
younger I-PER:Group
leadership I-PER:Group
took O
over O
from O
the O
founding O
generation O
. O

The B-ORG:Non-Governmental
two I-ORG:Non-Governmental
groups I-ORG:Non-Governmental
decided O
that O
the O
bickering O
between O
them B-ORG:Non-Governmental
was O
wasteful O
, O
conterproductive O
and O
pointless O
. O

There O
was O
talk O
of O
a O
( O
re O
) O
merger O
but O
the O
regulations O
governing O
non-profits B-ORG:Non-Governmental
prevented O
that O
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
NCA B-ORG:Non-Governmental
and O
ACS B-ORG:Non-Governmental
hold O
joint O
conventions O
to O
save O
on O
costs O
to O
both O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
clubs I-ORG:Non-Governmental
and O
the O
members O
. O

Just O
within O
the O
past O
couple O
of O
months O
though O
, O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
American I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Carousel I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Society I-ORG:Non-Governmental
had O
determined O
that O
they B-ORG:Non-Governmental
did O
not O
have O
the O
funding O
to O
continue O
with O
the O
operation O
of O
their B-ORG:Non-Governmental
organization I-ORG:Non-Governmental
and O
officially O
ceased O

exist O
. O

So O
now O
, O
once O
again O
there O
is O
a B-ORG:Non-Governmental

At O

up O

about B-ORG:Sports

For O
you B-ORG:Sports
northwestern I-ORG:Sports

really O
need O

someone B-PER:Indeterminate
at I-PER:Indeterminate
your I-PER:Indeterminate

that I-PER:Indeterminate
will I-PER:Indeterminate
listen I-PER:Indeterminate
. O

Our B-ORG:Educational
school I-ORG:Educational
did O
n't O
like O
us B-ORG:Sports
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
but O
we B-ORG:Sports
behaved O
ourselves B-ORG:Sports
, O
and O
very O
respectfully O
approached O
various B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
, O
working O
our B-ORG:Sports
way O
up O
the O
ladder O
, O
about O
changing O
some O
policies O
. O

Start O
off O
low O
, O
and O
work O
your B-ORG:Sports
way O
up O
. O

Explain O
to O
them B-PER:Indeterminate
that O
if O
you B-ORG:Sports
are O
driving O
your B-VEH:Land
own I-VEH:Land
cars I-VEH:Land
, O
you B-ORG:Sports
should O
be O
able O
to O
go O
wherever O
you B-ORG:Sports
want O
, O
and O
even O
throw O
in O
there O
if O
for O
any O
reason O
you B-ORG:Sports
bring O
shame O
to O
the B-ORG:Educational
university I-ORG:Educational
, O
you B-ORG:Sports
will O
go O
right O
back O
to O
the O
old O
policy O
no O
questions O
asked O
. O

How O
often O
do O
you B-ORG:Sports
go O
to O
a O
tournament O
and O
whatever O
happens O
there O
gets O
back O
to O
administration B-PER:Group
? O

pretty O
much O
never O
so O
your B-ORG:Sports
safe O
with O
that O

Another O
thing O
we B-ORG:Sports
did O
was O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
fundraisers O
on O
campus B-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
entered O
banner O
contests O
for O
sporting O
events O
, O

. O

Once O
the B-ORG:Educational

saw O
that O
unlike O
a B-ORG:Non-Governmental
lot I-ORG:Non-Governmental
of I-ORG:Non-Governmental
clubs I-ORG:Non-Governmental
, O
we B-ORG:Sports
were O
busting O
our B-ORG:Sports
asses O
to O
fundraise O
and O
get O
involved O
with O
school B-ORG:Educational
activities O
, O
their B-ORG:Educational
whole O
attitude O
towards O
us B-ORG:Sports
changed O
. O

Sell O
discs O
, O
sell O
pint O
glasses O
, O
then O
go O
to O
someone B-PER:Group
, O
more B-PER:Group
than I-PER:Group
one I-PER:Group
person I-PER:Group
, O
and O
show O
them B-PER:Group
what O
kind O
of O
effort O
you B-ORG:Sports
are O
putting O
in O
. O

A B-PER:Group
lot I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
school I-PER:Group
officials I-PER:Group
do O
n't O
understand O
how O
structured O
ultimate O
actually O
is O
. O

Go O
in O

explain O
to O
them B-PER:Group
about O

not O
just O
being O
some O
little O
" O
get O

My B-PER:Individual

were O
guests B-PER:Group
at I-PER:Group
a I-PER:Group
wedding I-PER:Group

the I-PER:Group
Carnival I-PER:Group
Legend I-PER:Group
on I-PER:Group
New I-PER:Group
Years I-PER:Group
Eve I-PER:Group
2003 I-PER:Group
. O

All B-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
guests I-PER:Group
were O
folks B-PER:Group
who I-PER:Group
had I-PER:Group
met I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
bride I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
groom I-PER:Group
( I-PER:Group
an I-PER:Group
attractive I-PER:Group
young I-PER:Group
couple I-PER:Group
who I-PER:Group
were I-PER:Group
sailing I-PER:Group
alone I-PER:Group
) I-PER:Group
virtually I-PER:Group
on I-PER:Group
cruisecritic I-PER:Group

The O
wedding O
took O
place O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
before O
the B-VEH:Water
ship I-VEH:Water
set O
sail O
. O

Thus O
, O
the B-PER:Group

was O
actual O
married O
by O
a B-PER:Individual

It O
was O
a O
great O
way O
to O
begin O
a O
cruise O
. O

Although O
I B-PER:Individual
am O
not O
certain O
of O
this O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
assume O
that O
renewing O
your B-PER:Indeterminate

could O
actually O
be O
done O
while O
the B-VEH:Water

on O

a O

both O

We B-PER:Group

into O
Heathrow B-FAC:Airport
on O
Monday O

. O

At O
the B-FAC:Airport

outside O

as O

I B-PER:Individual
just O
checked O
my B-PER:Individual

That O
was O
pretty O
easy O

the O
most O
difficult O
part O
was O
finding O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
hotel I-FAC:Building-Grounds
once O
we B-PER:Group
finally O
got O
off O
at O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
final I-FAC:Building-Grounds
tube I-FAC:Building-Grounds

. O

The B-ORG:Commercial
hotel I-ORG:Commercial
was O
nice O
enough O
to O
let O
us B-PER:Group
check O
in O
, O
even O
though O
we B-PER:Group
were O
a O
bit O
early O
( O
we B-PER:Group
got O
in O
around O
12:30 O
, O
normal O

in O
time O

14:30 O
) O
, O
which O
we B-PER:Group
were O
really O
grateful O
for O
, O
after O
dragging O
our B-PER:Group
bags O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
. O

After O
settling O
into O
the B-FAC:Subarea-Facility

( O
my B-PER:Individual

, O
we B-PER:Group
went O
to O
do O
a O
little O
exploring O
. O

Being O
that O
this O
was O
a O
holiday O
, O
a B-FAC:Building-Grounds
lot I-FAC:Building-Grounds
of I-FAC:Building-Grounds
the I-FAC:Building-Grounds
local I-FAC:Building-Grounds
places I-FAC:Building-Grounds
were O
closed O
( O
including O
restaurants B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
in I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
the I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
hotel I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
) O
, O
but O
we B-PER:Group
found O
a B-ORG:Commercial
kind I-ORG:Commercial
of I-ORG:Commercial
combo I-ORG:Commercial
newsagent I-ORG:Commercial
/ I-ORG:Commercial
foodstore I-ORG:Commercial
nearby O
, O
and O
we B-PER:Group

up O
a O

) O
. O

It O
took O
us B-PER:Group
awhile O
, O
but O
we B-PER:Group
found O
a O
restaurant O
/ O
pub O
( O
White B-FAC:Building-Grounds
Swan I-FAC:Building-Grounds
) O
that B-FAC:Building-Grounds
was O
open O
. O

It B-FAC:Building-Grounds
seemed O
like O
a B-FAC:Building-Grounds
kind I-FAC:Building-Grounds
of I-FAC:Building-Grounds
local I-FAC:Building-Grounds
place I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
and O
the B-PER:Individual
woman I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
was I-PER:Individual
running I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
place I-PER:Individual
was O
very O
nice O
. O

When O
we B-PER:Group
walked O
in O
, O
we B-PER:Group
stood O
around O
waiting O
to O
be O
seated O
:) O
, O
and O
she B-PER:Individual
said O
" O
this B-FAC:Building-Grounds
is O
a B-FAC:Building-Grounds
pub I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
sit O
anywhere O
, O
and O
order O
at O
the B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
bar I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
" O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
gathered O
( O
from O
that O
and O
a O
few O
visits O
at O
other B-FAC:Building-Grounds
pubs I-FAC:Building-Grounds
) O
that O
that O
's O
the O
norm O
. O

Anyway O
, O
we B-PER:Group
had O
a O
nice O
late O
lunch O
: O
fish O
and O
chips O
( O
with O
" O
mashed O
peas O
" O
) O
for O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
and O
a O
beef O
pie O
for O
my B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
. O

FYI B-PER:Indeterminate
, O
this O
was O
probably O
the O
most O
reasonable O
meal O
that O
we B-PER:Group
had O
during O
our B-PER:Group
whole O
visit O
. O

That O
night O
, O
we B-PER:Group
walked O
around O
the B-LOC:Region-General
area I-LOC:Region-General
around I-LOC:Region-General
the I-LOC:Region-General
Victoria I-LOC:Region-General
underground I-LOC:Region-General
station I-LOC:Region-General
, O
because O
we B-PER:Group
were O
suppose O
to O
meet O
up O
with O
a B-PER:Group
tour I-PER:Group
the O
next O
morning O
. O

While O
there O
, O
we B-PER:Group
found O
a B-FAC:Building-Grounds
local I-FAC:Building-Grounds
Sainsbury I-FAC:Building-Grounds
( I-FAC:Building-Grounds
kind I-FAC:Building-Grounds
of I-FAC:Building-Grounds
a I-FAC:Building-Grounds
small I-FAC:Building-Grounds
supermarket I-FAC:Building-Grounds
) I-FAC:Building-Grounds
about I-FAC:Building-Grounds
2 I-FAC:Building-Grounds
blocks I-FAC:Building-Grounds
from I-FAC:Building-Grounds
the I-FAC:Building-Grounds
underground I-FAC:Building-Grounds
station I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
and O
stocked O
up O
on O
some O
cheese O
, O
milk O
, O
and O
croissants O
. O

Prices O
here B-FAC:Building-Grounds
were O
a O
bit O
cheaper O
than O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
local I-FAC:Building-Grounds
foodstore I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
and O
during O
our B-PER:Group
trip O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
made O
several O
trips O
here B-FAC:Building-Grounds
:) O
. O

We B-PER:Group
were O
n't O
sure O
what O
we B-PER:Group
wanted O
to O
eat O
for O
dinner O
, O
so O
we B-PER:Group
just O
wandered O
around O
a O
bit O
, O
and O
finally O
ended O
up O
at O
a B-FAC:Building-Grounds
" I-FAC:Building-Grounds
steakhouse I-FAC:Building-Grounds
" I-FAC:Building-Grounds
near I-FAC:Building-Grounds
the I-FAC:Building-Grounds
station I-FAC:Building-Grounds
... O
big O
mistake O
. O

The O
food O
, O
service O
, O
and O
prices O
were O
very O
bad O
... O

I B-PER:Individual
guess O
we B-PER:Group
should O
have O
figured O
that O
one O
out O
when O
3 B-PER:Group
other I-PER:Group
parties I-PER:Group
walked O
out O
AFTER O
being O
seated O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
, O
we B-PER:Group
had O
already O
ordered O
, O
so O
we B-PER:Group
felt O
kind O
of O
obligated O
to O
finish O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
if O
this O
is O
the O
case O
with O
all B-ORG:Commercial
" I-ORG:Commercial
steakhouses I-ORG:Commercial
" O
, O
but O
we B-PER:Group
stayed O
away O
from O
them B-ORG:Commercial
all I-ORG:Commercial
after O
that O
:( O
. O

We B-PER:Group
took O
an O
all O
day O
bus B-VEH:Land
tour O
( O
Evan B-ORG:Commercial
Evans I-ORG:Commercial
) O
, O
including O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
London I-FAC:Building-Grounds
Eye I-FAC:Building-Grounds
. O

Took O
the B-VEH:Land
underground I-VEH:Land
to O
Victoria B-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
and O
walked O
to O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
Victoria I-FAC:Building-Grounds
Coach I-FAC:Building-Grounds
Station I-FAC:Building-Grounds
( O
it B-FAC:Building-Grounds
's O
NOT O
the O
same O
:) O
) O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
thought O
that O
the O
tour O
was O
a O
pretty O
good O
way O
to O
get O
introduced O
to O
part B-LOC:Region-General
of I-LOC:Region-General
the I-LOC:Region-General
city I-LOC:Region-General
. O

We B-PER:Group
got O
to O
see O
a O
lot O
in O
a O
short O
time O
, O
including O
extended O
tours O
of O
Westminster B-FAC:Building-Grounds
( O
felt O
kind O
of O
strange O
walking O
over O
dead B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
) O
and O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
Tower I-FAC:Building-Grounds
of I-FAC:Building-Grounds
London I-FAC:Building-Grounds
( O
neat O
! O
) O
. O

This O
tour O
included O
lunch O
at O
another B-FAC:Building-Grounds
pub I-FAC:Building-Grounds
near I-FAC:Building-Grounds
Trafalgar I-FAC:Building-Grounds
Square I-FAC:Building-Grounds
( O
more O
beef O
pies O
for O
us B-PER:Group
) O
, O
and O
the B-PER:Individual
tour I-PER:Individual
guide I-PER:Individual
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
kind O
of O
funny O
. O

It O
was O
kind O
of O
like O
travelling O
with O
a B-PER:Individual
" I-PER:Individual
grand I-PER:Individual
dad I-PER:Individual
" I-PER:Individual
and O
he B-PER:Individual
did O
his B-PER:Individual
best O
to O
keep O
us B-PER:Group
all O
together O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
land O
tour O
, O
we B-PER:Group
went O
on O
ride O
on O
one B-VEH:Water
of I-VEH:Water
the I-VEH:Water
Thames I-VEH:Water
cruise I-VEH:Water
boats I-VEH:Water

warning O

it O

) O
, O
and O
then O
a O
ride O
on O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
London I-FAC:Building-Grounds
Eye I-FAC:Building-Grounds
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
recommended O
, O
but O
afterwards O
, O
both O
my B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
and O
I B-PER:Individual
agreed O
that O
an O
" O
all O
- O
day O
" O
tour O
was O
too O
exhausting O
( O
even O
on O
a O
bus B-VEH:Land
tour O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
have O
to O
do O
a O
LOT O
of O
walking O
especially O
getting O
to O
the O
Changing O
of O
the B-PER:Group
Guards I-PER:Group
and O
at O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
London I-FAC:Building-Grounds
Tower I-FAC:Building-Grounds
) O
, O
and O
we B-PER:Group
probably O
would O
've O
preferred O
breaking O
it O
into O
2 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
day O
tours O
. O

We B-PER:Group
also O
took O
one O
of O
the O

off O

( O
the O
" O
Original O

) O
on O
one O
of O
the O
other O
day O
, O
as O
we B-PER:Group
thought O
it O
was O
the O
easiest O
way O
to O
get O
around O
to O
the B-LOC:Region-General
places I-LOC:Region-General
that I-LOC:Region-General
we I-LOC:Region-General
wanted I-LOC:Region-General
to I-LOC:Region-General
re-visit I-LOC:Region-General
. O

take O
the O
one O
with O
the B-PER:Individual
live I-PER:Individual

if O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
can O
, O
as O
it O
's O
much O
more O
interesting O
than O
the O
ones O
with O
the O
recorded O
commentary O
( O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
can O
ask O
questions O
) O
. O

Also O
, O
if O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
want O
to O
get O
a O
seat O
on O
the B-VEH:Subarea-Vehicle
top I-VEH:Subarea-Vehicle
deck I-VEH:Subarea-Vehicle
, O
take O
one B-VEH:Land
of I-VEH:Land
the I-VEH:Land
earlier I-VEH:Land
buses I-VEH:Land
, O
as O
at O
least O
when O
we B-PER:Group
were O
there O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
seat O
on B-VEH:Subarea-Vehicle
top I-VEH:Subarea-Vehicle
later O
in O
the O
day O
, O
and O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
ca O
n't O
see O
much O
from O
the B-VEH:Subarea-Vehicle
lower I-VEH:Subarea-Vehicle
( I-VEH:Subarea-Vehicle

) I-VEH:Subarea-Vehicle

( O
but O
it O
's O
much O
warmer O
:) O
! O
) O
. O

We B-PER:Group
had O
been O
buying O
the O

all O
- O
day O

everyday O
, O
just O
to O
get O
around O
to O
dinner O
and O
shopping O
on O
our B-PER:Group
own O
, O
but O
by O
the O
time O
this O
was O
all O
over O
, O
my B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
did O
n't O
feel O
like O
taking O
the B-VEH:Land
underground I-VEH:Land
back O
to O
Heathrow B-FAC:Airport
, O
so O
we B-PER:Group
had O
asked O
the B-PER:Individual
hotel I-PER:Individual
conceierge I-PER:Individual
to O
make O
a O
reservation O
on O
an B-VEH:Land
airport I-VEH:Land
bus I-VEH:Land
( O
15 B-Numeric:Money
GBP I-Numeric:Money
each O
) O
, O
but O
he B-PER:Individual
instead O
offered O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
could O
get O
us B-PER:Group
a B-VEH:Land
private I-VEH:Land
car I-VEH:Land
direct O
to O
the B-FAC:Airport
airport I-FAC:Airport
for O
35 B-Numeric:Money
GBP I-Numeric:Money
, O
which O
is O
what O
we B-PER:Group
did O
. O

This O
was O
perfect O
, O
because O
it B-VEH:Land
got O
us B-PER:Group
door O
- O
to O
- O
door O
from O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
hotel I-FAC:Building-Grounds
to O
LHR B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
Terminal I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
3 I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
with O
no O
hassles O
at O
all O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
would O
n't O
have O
done O
that O
from O
LHR B-FAC:Airport
to O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
hotel I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
but O
since O
the B-PER:Individual
concierge I-PER:Individual
was O
arranging O
it O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
felt O
that O
it O
'd O
be O
safe O
, O
and O
the B-PER:Individual
driver I-PER:Individual
turned O
out O
to O
be O
pretty O
nice O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
was O
an O
enjoyable O
, O
but O
really O
exhausting O
trip O
( O
we B-PER:Group
live O
in O
the B-LOC:Region-General
suburbs I-LOC:Region-General
, O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
we B-PER:Group
're O
not O
use O
to O
walking O
everywhere B-LOC:Region-General
) O
. O

Luckily O
this O
was O
n't O
a O
" O
shopping O
" O
trip O
, O
because O
things O
are O
( O
at O
least O
from O
Americans B-GPE:Nation
) O
really O
expensive O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
if O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
dealing O
in O

all O
the O
time O

it O

I B-PER:Individual
do O

any O
reason O

I B-PER:Individual
would O

heading O
back O

wherever O
and O
trying O
to O
carve O
out O

, O
if O
the O
drop O
off O

are O

Then O
you B-PER:Individual
could O
spend O
part O

one O

a O

could O
take O
the B-VEH:Land

It O
might O

like O

Toronto B-GPE:Population-Center

Niagara B-GPE:Population-Center

I B-PER:Individual

New B-GPE:Population-Center

would O
be O
nice O
to O
spend O
a O
few O

I B-PER:Individual

some O

we O

We B-PER:Group
're O
getting O

For O
a O
slightly O
different O
perspective O
: O

" O
Maharashtra B-PER:Group
officials I-PER:Group
say O
the O
cost O
of O
power O
supplied O
by O
Enron B-ORG:Commercial
is O
nearly O
double O
the O
tariff O
charged O
by O
Indian B-ORG:Commercial
power I-ORG:Commercial
producers I-ORG:Commercial
, O
and O
used O
it O
as O
an O
excuse O
to O
stop O
paying O
state B-GPE:State-or-Province
debts O
to O
the O
plant O
. O
" O

" O
Enron B-ORG:Commercial
had O
signed O
a O
power O
purchase O
agreement O
with O
power B-ORG:Commercial
utility I-ORG:Commercial
MSEB I-ORG:Commercial
eight O
years O

, O
under O
which O
a B-FAC:Plant
$ I-FAC:Plant

2,182 I-FAC:Plant
Megawatt I-FAC:Plant
power I-FAC:Plant
plant I-FAC:Plant
was O
to O
be O
commissioned O

But O
the O
project O
ran O
into O
trouble O
nearly O
two O
years O
ago O
with O
the B-PER:Group
Indian I-PER:Group
authorities I-PER:Group
beginning O
to O
delay O
payments O
saying O
Enron B-ORG:Commercial
's O
power O
tariff O
was O
too O
high O
... O

Though O
Enron B-PER:Group
officials I-PER:Group
refuse O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
price O
they B-PER:Group
would O
be O
willing O
to O
sell O
their B-PER:Group
stake O
at O
, O
analysts B-PER:Group
say O
the B-ORG:Commercial
US I-ORG:Commercial
company I-ORG:Commercial
is O
demanding O
about B-Numeric:Money
one I-Numeric:Money
billion I-Numeric:Money
dollars I-Numeric:Money
for O
its B-ORG:Commercial
investments O
in O
India O
. O

So O
far O
it B-ORG:Commercial
has O
only O
got O
offers O
of O
about O
half O
that O
amount O
from O
Indian B-ORG:Commercial
companies I-ORG:Commercial
and I-ORG:Commercial
financial I-ORG:Commercial
institutions I-ORG:Commercial
, O
but O
Enron B-ORG:Commercial
is O
unwilling O
to O
sell O
it O
s O
stake O
at O
a O
price O
lower O
than O
the O
cost O
. O

In O
case O
no O
satisfactory O
offer O
comes O
from O
the O
Indian B-GPE:Nation
side O
, O
Enron B-ORG:Commercial
will O
have O
little O
option O
but O
to O
go O
for O
international O
arbitration O
as O
their B-ORG:Commercial
investments O
in O
the B-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation
were O
guaranteed O
by O
the O
Indian O
Government O
. O

But O
arbitration O
proceedings O
can O
be O
a O
long O
and O
messy O
affair O
. O

Analysts B-PER:Group
say O
both O
India B-GPE:Nation
and O
Enron B-ORG:Commercial
have O
little O
to O
gain O
from O
a O
protracted O
legal O
battle O
. O

The O
best O
way O
out O
could O
be O
a O
compromise O
by O
which O
Enron B-ORG:Commercial
gets O
less O
than O
what O
it B-ORG:Commercial
is O
demanding O
and O
more O
than O
what O
the B-GPE:Nation
Indians I-GPE:Nation
are O
presently O
offering O
. O

IOW O
: O
No O
fraud O
, O
just O
a O
basic O
business B-ORG:Commercial
dispute O
, O
in O
which O
the B-GPE:State-or-Province

reneging I-GPE:State-or-Province

Iraq B-GPE:Nation
Elections O
at O
this O
point O

I B-PER:Individual
actually O
ca O
n't O
recall O
it O
ever O
taking O
2 O
weeks O
to O
" O
count O
" O
these O
many O
ballots O
, O
generally O
elections O
are O
called O
within O
24 O
hours O
. O

In O
this O
case O
counting O
is O
taking O
2 O
weeks O
. O

What O
is O
strange O
is O
everyone B-PER:Group
knows O
who B-PER:Individual
won O
, O
Sistani B-PER:Individual
won O
. O

His B-ORG:Non-Governmental
party I-ORG:Non-Governmental
, O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
major I-ORG:Non-Governmental
winner I-ORG:Non-Governmental
, O
could O
not O
field O
canidates B-PER:Group
until O
just O
before O
the O
election O
, O
but O
it O
was O
his B-PER:Individual
face O
on O
all O
the O
poster O
and O
his B-ORG:Non-Governmental
part I-ORG:Non-Governmental
wipped O
up O
the B-GPE:Nation
heavily I-GPE:Nation
funded I-GPE:Nation
US I-GPE:Nation
supported I-GPE:Nation
government I-GPE:Nation
. O

So O
we B-PER:Group
have O
the O
voice O
of O
the B-GPE:Nation
people I-GPE:Nation
of I-GPE:Nation
Iraq I-GPE:Nation
, O
even O
if O
the B-PER:Group
Sunni I-PER:Group
's I-PER:Group
had O
voted O
Sistani B-PER:Individual
would O
still O
be O
the B-PER:Individual
majority I-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
. O

But O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
not O
running O
. O

So O
the B-GPE:Nation
US I-GPE:Nation
has O
entered O
in O
to O
the O
classic O

Shia B-PER:Group
quicksand O
of O
Islamic B-GPE:Nation
Republics I-GPE:Nation
, O
which O
have O
caused O
it B-GPE:Nation
such O
problems O
in O
Iran B-GPE:Nation
. O

Sistani B-PER:Individual
will O
run O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
, O
or O
the O
election O
will O
be O
ignored O
. O

The O
problem O
with O
Sistani B-PER:Individual
running O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
is O
he B-PER:Individual
refuses O
to O
talk O
to O
the B-GPE:Nation
Ameircans I-GPE:Nation
, O
and O
as O
the B-PER:Individual
real I-PER:Individual
power I-PER:Individual
broker I-PER:Individual
what B-PER:Group
ever I-PER:Group
figure I-PER:Group
heads I-PER:Group
take I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
PM I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
other I-PER:Group
posts I-PER:Group
will O
speak O
with O
as O
little O
authority O
as O
their B-PER:Group
counter I-PER:Group
parts I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
Iran I-PER:Group
. O

The B-GPE:Nation
US I-GPE:Nation
is O
now O
fighting O
a O
war O
for O
a B-GPE:Nation
nation I-GPE:Nation
who I-GPE:Nation
government I-GPE:Nation
they I-GPE:Nation
have I-GPE:Nation
no I-GPE:Nation
direct I-GPE:Nation
ties I-GPE:Nation
with I-GPE:Nation
. O

The O
other O
option O
, O
and O
what O
the B-GPE:Nation
US I-GPE:Nation
seems O
to O
be O
trying O
, O
is O
to O
somehow O
fudge O
the O
election O
so O
Sistani B-PER:Individual
does O
not O
win O
, O
that O
raise O
doubts O
about O
the O
outcome O
, O
claiming O
fraud O
, O
do O
anything O
so O
that O
the O
election O
causes O
to O
results O
. O

Given O
the O
American B-GPE:Nation
attention O
span O
is O
about O
10 O
minuts O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
dictatorship O
of O
US B-PER:Group
puppets I-PER:Group
against I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
election I-PER:Group
would O
be O
ignored O
in O
the B-GPE:Nation
US I-GPE:Nation
. O

This O
would O
actually O
be O
not O
only O
in O
the B-GPE:Nation
US I-GPE:Nation
best O
interest O
, O
but O
might O
be O
militarily O
necessary O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
ca O
n't O
imagine O
how O
the O
US B-GPE:Nation
Occupation O
could O
operate O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
Sistani B-PER:Individual
has O
the O
ultimate O
power O
. O

In O
the O
long O
run O
I B-PER:Individual
ca O
n't O
see O
how O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
can O
avoid O
civil O
war O
, O
since O
its O
had O
it B-GPE:Nation
so O
many O
times O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Civil O
War O
leading O
to O
the O
victory O
of O
one B-PER:Group
group I-PER:Group
is O
the O
norm O
in O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
, O
and O
was O
the O
casue O
of O
most O
mass O
graves O
in O
the O
1980s O
and O
1990s O
. O

Likely O
only O
sanctions O
have O
killed O
more B-PER:Group
. O

Sistani B-PER:Individual
has O
the O
popular O
support O
and O
the O
claim O
of O
the O
election O
which O
the B-GPE:Nation
Ameircans I-GPE:Nation
bungled O
baddly O
and O
allowed O
him B-PER:Individual
to O
take O
over O
. O

The B-PER:Group
Sunni I-PER:Group
's I-PER:Group
have O
the B-WEA:Underspecified
weapons I-WEA:Underspecified
, O
the O
skill O
, O
and O
the O
support O
. O

The O
US B-GPE:Nation
occupation O
is O
becoming O
more O
difficult O
by O
the O
day O
and O
Bush B-PER:Individual
has O
shown O
he B-PER:Individual
fails O
to O
understand O
the O
situation O
. O

Hell O
when O
the O
worst O
possible O
event O
in O
the O
election O
was O
happening O
, O
Sistani B-PER:Individual
was O
flooding O
the O
polls O
with O
his B-PER:Group
supporters I-PER:Group
Bush B-PER:Individual
was O
crowing O
. O

Sadly O
Bush B-PER:Individual
's O
concerns O
are O
short O
- O
term O
politics O
in O
the B-LOC:Region-General
South I-LOC:Region-General
of I-LOC:Region-General
Ameirca I-LOC:Region-General
, O
and O
they B-PER:Group
have O
already O
decided O
they B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
have O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
. O

With O
more B-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
mmore I-PER:Group
Sunni I-PER:Group
supporting O
the B-PER:Group
insurgents I-PER:Group
Iran B-GPE:Nation
, O
the B-GPE:Nation
big I-GPE:Nation
winner I-GPE:Nation
in I-GPE:Nation
all I-GPE:Nation
of I-GPE:Nation
this I-GPE:Nation
, O
will O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
back O
Sistani B-PER:Individual
in O
the B-LOC:Region-General
south I-LOC:Region-General
. O

So O
if O
the B-GPE:Nation
US I-GPE:Nation
leaves O
it O
s O
possible O
we B-PER:Group
could O
see O
Iraq B-GPE:Nation
carved O
up O
between O

groups I-PER:Group
. O

As O
for O

It O
is O
pretty O
bizarre O

considering O
how O
long O
they B-PER:Group
had O
to O
organize O
elections O
. O

It O
may O
be O
that O
they B-PER:Group

taking O

The B-GPE:Nation

not O
going O

change O

A B-GPE:Nation

us B-GPE:Nation
an O

All O
we B-GPE:Nation

not O

I B-PER:Individual
myself B-PER:Individual
would O

happier O

a B-ORG:Government
Mushariff I-ORG:Government

is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
keep O

out O

In O
my B-PER:Individual
opinion O
, O
all O
we B-GPE:Nation
have O
to O
the B-PER:Individual
average I-PER:Individual
Iraqi I-PER:Individual
citizen I-PER:Individual

brought O

the O
ones O

expounded O
that O

was O
about O
to O

attacked O
, O
and O
let O
it O
happen O
. O

One O
of O
their B-PER:Group
" O
proofs O
" O
was O
that O
the B-VEH:Water
US I-VEH:Water
carriers I-VEH:Water
were O
out O
of O

during O
the O

" O
carriers B-VEH:Water
were O
the O
capital O

However O
, O
the B-VEH:Water
two I-VEH:Water
carriers I-VEH:Water
operating I-VEH:Water
out I-VEH:Water
of I-VEH:Water

the I-VEH:Water
moment I-VEH:Water

on O
possibly O
intersecting O

at O
Pearl B-FAC:Building-Grounds
by O
Dec O

but O
got O

by O
a O

. O

Consequently O
, O
for O
the B-PER:Group
PH I-PER:Group
conspiracy I-PER:Group
theorists I-PER:Group
to O
believe O
that O
FDR B-PER:Individual
kept O
the B-VEH:Water
carriers I-VEH:Water
out O
of O
harm O
's O
way O
, O
we B-PER:Group
not O
only O
have O
to O
grant O
FDR B-PER:Individual
the O
full O
knowledge O
of O
Kido B-VEH:Water
Butai I-VEH:Water
's O
route O
of O
approach O
would O
not O
result O
in O
either B-VEH:Water
USN I-VEH:Water
carrier I-VEH:Water
fleet I-VEH:Water
getting O
caught O
in O
a O
hopeless O
battle O
, O
but O
that O
FDR B-PER:Individual
could O
psychically O
manipulate O
the O
weather O
to O
prevent O
Halsey B-PER:Individual
from O
sailing O
into O
Pearl B-FAC:Building-Grounds
and O
thus O
be O
ambushed O
. O

To O
make O
a O
very O
long O
story O
short O
, O
it O
is O
foolish O
to O
assume O
that O
the B-GPE:Nation
US I-GPE:Nation
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
war O
against O
Japan B-GPE:Nation

with O

forty B-Numeric:Percent

of O

not O
that O

he B-PER:Individual

It O
can O

be O
argued O
that O
the B-PER:Individual

of I-PER:Individual
a I-PER:Individual
united I-PER:Individual

might O

done O
better O
than O
all O
the B-PER:Group

because O
the O
mere O
fact O
of O
the O
divided O
nature O
of O
Lincoln B-PER:Group
's I-PER:Group
opposition I-PER:Group
might O
have O
discouraged O

fewer B-PER:Group

given O
that O

quite O
high O

I B-PER:Individual

it O

important O

that O
African B-PER:Group
Americans I-PER:Group
, O
though O
still O
overwhelmingly O
Democratic O
, O
comprise O
less O
of O
a O
monolith O
than O
they B-PER:Group
did O
20 O

30 O

I B-PER:Individual
find O
myself B-PER:Individual
continually O

how O
open O

many B-PER:Group

African I-PER:Group
- I-PER:Group
Americans I-PER:Group
are O
. O

And O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
open-mindedness O
goes O
a O
long O
way O
to O
explain O
the O
desperate O
efforts O
of O
many B-PER:Group
( I-PER:Group
not I-PER:Group
all I-PER:Group

with O
the O
cry O
of O
" O

, O

" O
when O
the O
evidence O
of O

is O
increasingly O
a O
stretch O

It O
's O
like O
how O
, O
after O
the O
Civil O

, O
Republicans B-ORG:Non-Governmental
" O
waved O

with O
the O

, O
ultimately O
, O
the O

itself O

Eventually O
, O
that O

lost O
its O

And O
so O

too O

will O
the O

Hand O

with O
any O
consideration O
of O
the O

we B-PER:Group
shoul O
give O
some O

to O
the O

Currently O

while O
each B-PER:Individual

Often O
as O

there O

I B-PER:Individual
believe O
this O
accounts O

in O
large O

for O
the O

Former B-PER:Individual

in O
this O

two I-PER:Group

in O
a O
way O
that O

He B-PER:Individual
has O
suggested O
that O
we B-GPE:State-or-Province
either O
increase O
membership B-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
Senate I-PER:Group
to O
50 B-PER:Group
, O
or O
decrease O
House B-PER:Group
membership I-PER:Group
to O
80 B-PER:Group
, O
producing O
a O
scenario O
wherein O
1 B-PER:Individual
Senator I-PER:Individual
would O
represent O
a B-PER:Group
block I-PER:Group

people I-PER:Group
who I-PER:Group
are I-PER:Group
represented I-PER:Group

exactly I-PER:Group

He B-PER:Individual
thinks O

and O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
he B-PER:Individual
is O
right O

that O
this O
arrangement O
would O
foster O

closer O

You B-PER:Indeterminate

have O
these B-PER:Group

now I-PER:Group

to O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
: O

There O
are O
people B-PER:Group
dying I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
Iraq I-PER:Group
, O
but O
the O
reason O
people B-PER:Group
are O
dying O

because O
of O
the O

the B-PER:Group

Now O
what O
should O
our B-GPE:Nation

understand O
how O
precious O
what O

those B-PER:Group

up O

a O
article O
written O
in O
yesterdays O
Houston B-ORG:Media

It O
describes O
how O
the B-ORG:Government
European I-ORG:Government
Governments I-ORG:Government
look O
to O
be O
changing O
their B-ORG:Government
tune O
in O
regards O
to O
President B-PER:Individual
Bush I-PER:Individual
. O

But O
there O
is O
arguably O
more O
to O
this O
sea O
change O
than O
just O
a O
grumpy O
acceptance O
of O
the O
status O
quo O
. O

From O
a O
European B-GPE:Continent
perspective O
, O
three O
things O
are O
making O
it O
easier O
to O
warm O
to O
the B-ORG:Government
Bush I-ORG:Government
White I-ORG:Government
House I-ORG:Government
. O

One O
is O
the O
death O
of O
Yasser B-PER:Individual
Arafat I-PER:Individual
. O

No O
issue O
divides O
Europe B-GPE:Continent
and O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
more O
keenly O
than O
the O
Israeli- B-GPE:Nation
Palestinian B-GPE:Special
dispute O
. O

For O
the O
last O
few O
years O
, O
Europeans B-GPE:Continent
have O
criticized O
Bush B-PER:Individual
for O
failing O
to O
put O
enough O
pressure O
on O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
to O
get O
out O
of O
the B-LOC:Region-General
occupied I-LOC:Region-General
territories I-LOC:Region-General
and O
for O
refusing O
to O
deal O
with O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
. O

That O
another O
reason O
why O
I B-PER:Individual
respect O
Bush B-PER:Individual
so O
much O
, O
his B-PER:Individual
refusal O
to O
acknowledge O
that B-PER:Individual
windbag I-PER:Individual
terrorist I-PER:Individual
Arafat B-PER:Individual
. O

May O
he B-PER:Individual
rot O
in O

. O

But O
since O
Arafat B-PER:Individual
's O
death O
, O
Europeans B-GPE:Continent
and O
Americans B-GPE:Nation
have O
been O
able O
to O
find O
common O
ground O
: O
supporting O
Ariel B-PER:Individual
Sharon I-PER:Individual
's O
withdrawal O
from O
Gaza B-LOC:Region-General
, O
putting O
pressure O
on O
Israel B-GPE:Nation
to O
let O
the B-GPE:Special
Palestinians I-GPE:Special
hold O
elections O
and O
, O
covertly O
, O
backing O
Mahmoud B-PER:Individual
Abbas I-PER:Individual
to O
become O
the B-PER:Individual
next I-PER:Individual
Palestinian I-PER:Individual
leader I-PER:Individual
. O

A O
second O
reason O
is O
Europe B-GPE:Continent
's O
growing O
worries O
about O
Islamic B-PER:Group
terrorism O
. O

The O
murder O
in O
November O
of O
Theo B-PER:Individual

, O
a B-PER:Individual
provocative I-PER:Individual
Dutch I-PER:Individual

, O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
an B-PER:Individual
Islamic I-PER:Individual
militant I-PER:Individual
has O
been O
called O
Europe B-GPE:Continent
's O
9/11 O
. O

Though O
the O
two O
events O
are O
obviously O
not O
fully O
comparable O
, O
it O
is O
certainly O
true O
that O
American B-PER:Group
conservatives I-PER:Group
, O
such O
as O
Francis B-PER:Individual
Fukuyama I-PER:Individual
and O
Bernard B-PER:Individual
Lewis I-PER:Individual
, O
have O
found O
a B-PER:Group
wider I-PER:Group
audience I-PER:Group
recently O
for O
the O
idea O
that O
radical O
Islam O
is O
inimical O
to O
European B-GPE:Continent
traditions O
of O
tolerance O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
mean O
those B-PER:Group
radical I-PER:Group
muslims I-PER:Group
can O
be O
kinda O
nasty O
sometimes O
? O

Keep O
doing O
business O
like O
the B-PER:Group
cowards I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
Spain I-PER:Group
and O
they B-GPE:Continent
will O
more O
then O
likely O
have O
their B-GPE:Continent
very O
own B-GPE:Continent
9/11 O
to O
cry O
about O
. O

The O
third O
force O
is O
the O
reappearance O
, O
albeit O
in O
a O
milder O
form O
, O
of O
the O
threat O
that O
kept O
the B-GPE:Nation
trans I-GPE:Nation

his B-LOC:Region-International
" I-LOC:Region-International

" O

They B-PER:Group
should O
be O
very O
worried O
about O
this O
item O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
believe O
Putin B-PER:Individual
is O
slowly O
sliding O
Russia B-GPE:Nation
back O
to O
what O
it B-GPE:Nation

Hopefully O
our B-GPE:Nation

is O

asleep O
at O
the O
wheel O
with O
this O
situation O
either O

There O
is O
a O
personal O
edge O

all O
this O

grudging O

inarticulate I-PER:Individual
Texan I-PER:Individual

Many B-PER:Group
European I-PER:Group

once O
swallowed O
the O
Michael B-PER:Individual
Moore I-PER:Individual
version O
of O
history O
: O
that O
Bush B-PER:Individual

an B-PER:Individual
ignorant I-PER:Individual
interloper I-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
stole I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
White I-PER:Individual

His B-PER:Individual
thumping O

shows O
that O

represents O
a O
large O
body O
of O
conservative B-GPE:Nation
American I-GPE:Nation
opinion O

In O
short O
, O
Europeans B-GPE:Continent
are O
getting O

the O
idea O
that O
it O
is O
not O
Bush B-PER:Individual
who B-PER:Individual

but O
the B-GPE:Nation

I B-PER:Individual
'm O

Also O

I B-PER:Individual

by O
10:30 O

every O

I B-PER:Individual

between O
11:30 O

, O
but O
now O
, O
eating O

all O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
about O
after O

Why O
is O
that O
good O
for O
me B-PER:Individual
? O

I B-PER:Individual
do O

I B-PER:Individual
leave O

For O
that O

, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
care O
about O
any O

Auburn B-ORG:Sports

CBS B-ORG:Media
against O

If O
they B-ORG:Sports

up O

keep O
the O

Game O
in O
December O
, O
Georgia B-ORG:Sports
must O
beat O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports

This O
game O
is O
as O
good O
as O
it O
gets O
. O

Sure O
, O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
's I-ORG:Sports
in I-ORG:Sports
- I-ORG:Sports
state I-ORG:Sports
rival I-ORG:Sports
is O
Alabama B-ORG:Sports
, O
but O
year O
in O
and O
year O
out O
, O
this O
game O
, O
the O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
- O
UGA B-ORG:Sports
game O
, O
seems O
like O
the O
one O
that O
matters O
more O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
seldom O
if O
ever O
root O
for O
Bama B-ORG:Sports
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
always O
root O
for O
UGA B-ORG:Sports
to O
be O
undefeated O
when O
the B-ORG:Sports
play O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
. O

The O
game O
is O
big O
enough O
already O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
even O
bigger O
when O
one B-ORG:Sports
or I-ORG:Sports
both I-ORG:Sports
teams I-ORG:Sports
have O
something O
on O
the O
line O
. O

Yes O
, O
both B-ORG:Sports
teams I-ORG:Sports
have O
other O
games O
left O
to O
play O
and O
yes O
, O
other B-ORG:Sports
teams I-ORG:Sports
' O
results O
may O
affect O
what O
happens O
to O
both B-ORG:Sports
of I-ORG:Sports
these I-ORG:Sports
teams I-ORG:Sports
, O
but O
in O
just O
five O
days O
, O
these B-ORG:Sports
two I-ORG:Sports
teams I-ORG:Sports
will O
play O
the O
biggest O
and O
most O
important O
game O
of O
their B-ORG:Sports
season O
. O

So O
now O
it O
's O
time O
for O
all O
of O
the O
yapping O
and O
jawing O
and O
talking O
shit O
that O
goes O
with O
this O
game O
. O

Except O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
do O
that O
. O

Anytime O
I B-PER:Individual
try O
to O
talk O
shit O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
get O
all O
nauseous O
and O
worry O
about O
what O
happens O
not O
if O
but O
WHEN O
we B-ORG:Sports
lose O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
just O
me B-PER:Individual
or O
if O
being O
this O
pragmatic O
is O
what O
it O
means O
to O
be O
an B-PER:Individual
Auburn I-PER:Individual
fan I-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
wonder O
if O
deep O
down O
THIS O
is O
what O
it O
feels O
like O
to O
be O
a B-PER:Individual
Red I-PER:Individual

: O
regardless O
of O
where O
you B-PER:Individual
are O
or O
what O
is O
happening O
to O
your B-ORG:Sports
team I-ORG:Sports
, O
deep O
down O
you B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
just O
think O
, O
you B-PER:Individual
KNOW O
something O
bad O
is O
going O
to O
happen O

Anyway O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
am O
flying O
my B-PER:Individual

on O
my B-FAC:Building-Grounds
house I-FAC:Building-Grounds
with O
pride O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
am O
looking O
forward O
to O
the O
game O
that O
, O
year O
in O
and O
year O
out O
, O
gives O
us B-PER:Group
the O
best O
hitting O

mos O
entertaining O

the O

. O

It O
's O
SEC B-ORG:Sports
football O
at O
it O

It O
's O
now O
just O
one O
day O
until O
I B-PER:Individual
hop O
in O
the B-VEH:Land

and O
head O
back O
in O

I B-PER:Individual
have O
n't O
been O
back O
since O
1994 O
and O
when O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
talking O
to O
my B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
about O
the O
trip O
this O
morning O
, O
it O
seems O
like O
a O
lifetime O
ago O
. O

Hell O
, O
it O
's O
been O
half O
my B-PER:Individual
life O
since O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
in O
school B-FAC:Building-Grounds
there B-GPE:Population-Center
and O
over O
two O
thirds O
of O
my B-PER:Individual
adult B-PER:Individual
life O
, O
assuming O
that O
people B-PER:Group
that I-PER:Group
know I-PER:Group
me I-PER:Group
think O
my B-PER:Individual
adult B-PER:Individual
life O
has O
actually O
started O
yet O
. O

Anyway O
, O
enough O
nostalgia O
from O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
at O
least O
for O
now O
. O

The B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
and O
I B-PER:Individual
were O
watching O
SportsCenter O
this O
morning O
, O
and O
Lee B-PER:Individual
Corso I-PER:Individual
, O
Mark B-PER:Individual
May I-PER:Individual
and O
Trev B-PER:Individual
Alberts I-PER:Individual
were O
ALL O
picking O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
to O
beat O
Georgia B-ORG:Sports
, O
and O
the B-PER:Group
last I-PER:Group
two I-PER:Group
were O
picking O
them B-ORG:Sports
to O
run O
the O
table O
for O
the O
right O
to O
play O
USC B-ORG:Sports
for O
the O

. O

Then O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
open O
the O
Atlanta B-GPE:Population-Center
paper O
this O
morning O
, O
and O
EVERYTHING O
is O
pro-UGA B-ORG:Sports
. O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
knew O
it O
would O
be O
, O
but O
some O
of O
it O
was O
even O
based O
on O
facts O
. O

When O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
and O
their B-ORG:Sports
opponent I-ORG:Sports
are O
both O
in O
the O
top O
ten O
, O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
is O
4 O
- O
6 O

1 O
in O
those O
games O
. O

Auburn B-ORG:Sports
has O
lost O
the O
last O
three O
games O
that O
fit O
that O
scenario O
. O

Auburn B-ORG:Sports
's O
last O
defeat O
came O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
... O
UGA B-ORG:Sports

Auburn B-ORG:Sports
does O
lead O
the O
overall O
record O
in O

This O
trend O
was O
serious O
in O
the O
80's O
, O
with O
the B-PER:Group
road I-PER:Group
team I-PER:Group
winning O
about O
two O
- O
thirds O
of O
the O
time O
. O

The O
only O
time O
this O
changed O
recently O
really O
was O
when O
UGA B-ORG:Sports
decided O
to O
win O
in O
their B-PER:Group
place O
in O
2003 O
. O

On O
the O
upside O
, O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
has O
scored O
at O

33 O
points O
in O
the O
last O
six O
games O

That O
's O
a O
pretty O
nice O

Auburn B-ORG:Sports

Here O

the O
biggest O
for O
what O
it O

as O
far O
as O
I B-PER:Individual
am O
concerned O
: O
both B-ORG:Sports

undefeated O
this O

Auburn B-ORG:Sports

8 O

0 O
and O
UGA B-ORG:Sports
is O
5 O
- O
0 O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
'd O
say O
that O
's O
the O
biggest O
stat O
right O
now O
. O

Auburn B-ORG:Sports
's O
offense O
is O
potent O
and O
efficient O
. O

UGA B-ORG:Sports
's O
defense O
is O
relentless O
and O
contains O
a B-PER:Group
couple I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group

biggest I-PER:Group

, I-PER:Group
especially I-PER:Group
Greg I-PER:Group
Blue I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
Odell I-PER:Group
Thurman I-PER:Group
. O

Auburn B-ORG:Sports
's O
defense O
is O
fast O
and O
relentless O
and O
the B-PER:Group
DB I-PER:Group
's O
are O
experienced O
and O
big O
. O

UGA B-PER:Group

receivers I-PER:Group

leaders B-PER:Group
, O
with O
one B-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
them I-PER:Individual
a B-PER:Individual
team I-PER:Individual
captain I-PER:Individual
. O

Auburn B-PER:Group
's I-PER:Group
two I-PER:Group
running I-PER:Group
backs I-PER:Group
are O
seniors B-PER:Group

very B-PER:Group

dangerous I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group

UGA B-PER:Group

freshmen I-PER:Group
with I-PER:Group
less I-PER:Group
experience I-PER:Group
, O
but O
are O
dangerous O
as O
well O
. O

In O
my B-PER:Individual
mind O
, O
the O
game O
is O
going O
to O
turn O
on O
a O
few O
key O
points O
, O
some O
obvious O
and O
some O
not O
. O

Here O
goes O
the O
prediction O
machine O
: O

- O
Turnovers O
( O
as O
always O
) O
will O
be O
critical O
. O

- O
Special B-PER:Group
teams I-PER:Group
play O
and O
lack O
of O
special B-PER:Group
teams I-PER:Group
mistakes O
will O
tell O
the O
tale O
regarding O
field B-LOC:Region-General
position O
. O

- O
Both B-ORG:Sports
teams I-ORG:Sports
MUST O
establish O
the O
run O
to O
be O
successful O
. O

If O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
goes O
for O
150 O
between O
their B-PER:Group
two I-PER:Group
backs I-PER:Group
, O
they B-ORG:Sports
're O
almost O
impossible O
to O
beat O
. O

Conversely O
, O
Georgia B-ORG:Sports
MUST O
be O
able O
to O
run O
the O
ball O
to O
set O
up O
play O
action O
and O
keep O
the O
pressure O
off O
of O
David B-PER:Individual
Greene I-PER:Individual
. O

- O
Mark B-PER:Individual
Richt I-PER:Individual
has O
proven O
to O
be O
a B-PER:Individual
better I-PER:Individual
on I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual

Tuberville I-PER:Individual

Tubs B-PER:Individual
is O
famous O
for O
taking O
chances O
, O
often O
unnecessary O
ones O
. O

That O
history O
is O
of O
concern O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
. O

While O
it O
's O
okay O
to O
try O
crazy O
shit O
when O
your B-PER:Group
team I-PER:Group
is O
under O
- O
rated O
or O
a B-PER:Group
serious I-PER:Group
underdog I-PER:Group
, O
it O
's O
important O
not O
to O
give O
games O
away O
when O
you B-PER:Group
're O
the B-PER:Group
favorite I-PER:Group
. O

Playing O
more O
" O
by O
the O
book O
" O
and O
a O
bit O
" O
closer O
to O
the O

" O
becomes O
the O
call O
for O
the O
day O
. O

Considering O
all O
of O
these O
factors O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
truly O
believe O
that O
this O
is O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
's O
year O
. O

They B-ORG:Sports
may O
not O
go O
undefeated O
and O
they B-ORG:Sports
may O
not O
get O
into O
the O
BCS B-ORG:Sports
title O
game O
, O
but O
they B-ORG:Sports
have O
enough O
talent O
, O
poise O
and O
experience O
to O
win O
this O
game O
. O

And O
now O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
have O
typed O
that O
prediction O

I B-PER:Individual
may O
just O
throw O
up O

In O
1989 O
, O
Alabama B-ORG:Sports
was O
10 O

number O
two O
in O
the B-GPE:Nation
nation I-GPE:Nation

coming O
into O

ever O
to O
play O
at O
Jordan B-FAC:Building-Grounds
- I-FAC:Building-Grounds
Hare I-FAC:Building-Grounds
Stadium I-FAC:Building-Grounds
. O

All O
the O
talk O
for O
the O
weeks O
leading O
up O
to O
the O
game O
was O
about O
" O
if O
Bama B-ORG:Sports
's O
undefeated O
, O
they B-ORG:Sports
'll O
play O
for O
it O
all O
in O
the O
Sugar O
Bowl O
" O
and O
other O
crap O
like O
that O
. O

Well O
, O
" O
if O
or O
when O
" O
never O
happened O
because O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
won O
30 O
- O
20 O
in O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
Iron O

games O
ever O
, O
putting O
an O
end O
to O
Bama B-ORG:Sports
's O
national O
title O
hopes O
for O
the O
year O
. O

15 O
years O
later O
, O
the O
situation O
's O
reversed O
. O

It O
's O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
that O
's O
undefeated O
and O
facing O
the O
road O
game O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
about O
nauseous O
about O
this O
game O
too O
. O

Despite O
being O
riddled O
with O
injuries O
, O
Alabama B-ORG:Sports
has O
a B-PER:Group
ridiculously I-PER:Group
stout I-PER:Group
defense I-PER:Group
, O
recently O
ranked O
as O
the B-PER:Group
number I-PER:Group
one I-PER:Group
defense I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
country I-PER:Group
. O

Has O
all O
of O
the O
bluster O
and O
talking O
shown O
up O
on O
The O
Plains O
as O
well O
? O

I B-PER:Individual
only O
hope O
that O
Coach B-PER:Individual
Tuberville I-PER:Individual
has O
been O
successful O
at O
keeping O
his B-PER:Group
players I-PER:Group
focused O
, O
motivated O
and O
thinking O
about O
ONLY O
the O
Alabama B-ORG:Sports
game O
. O

Do O
people O
never O
learn O
from O
the O
mistakes O
of O
others O
? O

For O
those B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
you I-PER:Group
not I-PER:Group
from I-PER:Group
around I-PER:Group
these I-PER:Group
parts I-PER:Group
, O
Linda B-PER:Individual
Schrenko I-PER:Individual
WAS O
the B-PER:Individual
State I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
Georgia I-PER:Individual
's I-PER:Individual
Superintendant I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
schools I-PER:Individual
. O

It O
seems O
that O
in O
recent O
years O
, O
instead O
of O
doing O
the B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
's O
business O
, O
good B-PER:Individual
ole I-PER:Individual
Linda I-PER:Individual
has O
spent O
her B-PER:Individual
time O
stealing O
over B-Numeric:Money
600 I-Numeric:Money
grand I-Numeric:Money
in O
Federal O
Education O
funds O
. O

She B-PER:Individual
used O
it O
for O
various O
things O
, O
but O
the O
favorite O
is O
the B-Numeric:Money
nine I-Numeric:Money
grand I-Numeric:Money
she B-PER:Individual
spent O
on O
a O
facelift O
. O

Here O
's O
a O
link O
to O
the O
story O
: O

One O
thing O
that O
made O
me B-PER:Individual
laugh O
is O
that O
she B-PER:Individual
showed O
up O
at O
her B-PER:Individual
indictment O
in O
a O
fur O
coat O
. O

Ummm O
, O
am O
I B-PER:Individual
the B-PER:Individual
only I-PER:Individual
one I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
learned I-PER:Individual
anything I-PER:Individual
from I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
Michael I-PER:Individual
Irvin I-PER:Individual
drug I-PER:Individual
trial I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
mid I-PER:Individual
90's I-PER:Individual
? O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
never O
EVER O
show O
up O
at O
court B-ORG:Government
, O
especially O
facing O
indictment O
for O
stealing B-Crime
large I-Crime
sums I-Crime
of I-Crime
money I-Crime
, O
wearing O
a O
fucking O
FUR O
COAT O
!! O

Fake O
or O
not O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
look O
like O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
're O
rubbing O
the B-PER:Individual
common I-PER:Individual
man I-PER:Individual
's O
nose O
in O
it O
. O

Schrenko B-PER:Individual
is O
a B-PER:Individual
scumbag I-PER:Individual
and O
, O
although O
she B-PER:Individual
wo O
n't O
get O
any O
actual B-Sentence
jail I-Sentence
time I-Sentence
, O
I B-PER:Individual
hope O
the O
fine O
she B-PER:Individual
pleads O
to O
is O
at O
least O
as O
much O
as O
what O
she B-PER:Individual
stole O
. O

Remember O
when O
Michael B-PER:Individual
Milken I-PER:Individual
got O
busted O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
not O
forced O
to O
give O
up O
his B-PER:Individual
secret O
accounts O
, O
and O
when O
the O
fine O
of O
600 B-Numeric:Money
million I-Numeric:Money
was O
levied O
... O
HE B-PER:Individual
PAID O
IT O
!! O

Hell O
, O
at O
his B-PER:Individual
zenith O
, O
that O
's O
what O
he B-PER:Individual
made O
in O
ONE O
YEAR O
!! O

Yeah O
, O
lemme B-PER:Individual
just O
get O
my B-PER:Individual
checkbook O
out O
of O
my B-PER:Individual
diamond O
encrusted O
briefcase O
. O
" O

Schrenko B-PER:Individual
stole O
20 O
times O
what O
Martha B-PER:Individual
Stewart I-PER:Individual
did O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
bet O
she B-PER:Individual
wo O
n't O
see O
the O
wrong O
side O
of O
a O
jail B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
cell I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
door O
, O
and O
that O
's O
sad O
. O

Because O
it O
's O
people B-PER:Group
like I-PER:Group
Schrenko I-PER:Group
for I-PER:Group
which I-PER:Group
jails I-PER:Group
were I-PER:Group
specifically I-PER:Group
designed I-PER:Group
... O

Well O
, O
it O
's O
mid-morning O
on O
the B-LOC:Region-General
East I-LOC:Region-General
coast I-LOC:Region-General
and O
I B-PER:Individual
am O
sitting O
here O
running O
numbers O
thru O
my B-PER:Individual
head O
trying O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
's O
going O
to O
happen O
in O
the O
Iron O
Bowl O
, O
which O
is O
just O
over O
29 O
hours O
away O
. O

The O
game O
is O
being O
played O
in O
Tuscaloosa B-GPE:Population-Center
, O
which O
should O
be O
an O
advantage O
to O
Alabama B-ORG:Sports
. O

However O
, O
In O
the O
two O
times O
the O
game O
has O
been O
played O
in O
Bryant B-FAC:Building-Grounds
Denny I-FAC:Building-Grounds
Stadium I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
has O
won O
. O

Alabama B-ORG:Sports
has O
one B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
stingiest I-PER:Group
defenses I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
country I-PER:Group
, O
and O
were O
ranked O
number O
one O
in O
overall O
defense O
as O
recently O
as O
last O
week O
. O

Conversely O
, O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
has O
one B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
most I-PER:Group
potent I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
balanced I-PER:Group
offensive I-PER:Group
attacks I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
nation I-PER:Group
. O

Also O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
Bama B-ORG:Sports
has O
faced O
an B-PER:Group
attack I-PER:Group
with I-PER:Group
two I-PER:Group
great I-PER:Group
runners I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
a I-PER:Group
great I-PER:Group
line I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
a I-PER:Group
poised I-PER:Group
QB I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
good I-PER:Group
receivers I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
a I-PER:Group
tight I-PER:Group
end I-PER:Group
as O
well O
. O

Bama B-ORG:Sports
is O
missing O
it B-PER:Group
's I-PER:Group
starting I-PER:Group
offensive I-PER:Group
backfield I-PER:Group
from O
the O
start O
of O
the O
season O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
they B-ORG:Sports
've O
won O
six O
games O
is O
a O
testament O
to O
the O
coaching O
and O
heart O
of O
the B-PER:Group
players I-PER:Group
. O

Alabama B-ORG:Sports
simply O
can O
not O
throw O
the O
football O
, O
which O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
because O
Auburn B-PER:Group
's I-PER:Group
defensive I-PER:Group
backfield I-PER:Group
is O
second O
to O
none O
. O

Bama B-ORG:Sports
can O
run O
the O
ball O
however O
. O

Unfortunately O
for O
them B-ORG:Sports
, O
with O
no O
passing O
game O
to O
keep O
the B-PER:Group
defense I-PER:Group
honest O
, O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
will O
probably O
stack O
nine O
in O
the O
box O
, O
play O
man O
on O
the O
corners O
, O
and O
dare O
Bama B-ORG:Sports
to O
run O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
think O
they B-ORG:Sports
'll O
be O
able O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Auburn B-ORG:Sports
is O
also O
9 O
- O
0 O
when O
they B-ORG:Sports
score O
first O
. O

The O
Tuberville B-PER:Individual
way O
is O
to O
get O
one O
quick O
and O
early O
to O
get O
your B-PER:Group
crowd I-PER:Group
into O
it O
if O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
're O
at O
home B-LOC:Region-General
and O
to O
quiet O
the B-PER:Group
other I-PER:Group
team I-PER:Group
's I-PER:Group
crowd I-PER:Group
if O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
're O
on O
the O
road O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
can O
never O
tell O
what O
is O
going O
to O
happen O
in O
rivalry O
games O
. O

In O
this O
exact O
game O
15 O
years O
ago O
, O
Bama B-ORG:Sports
came O
into O
Auburn B-GPE:Population-Center
# O
2 O
in O
the B-GPE:Nation
country I-GPE:Nation
, O
undefeated O
at O
10 O
- O
0 O
and O
looking O
for O
yet O
another O
national O
championship O
. O

They B-ORG:Sports
were O
summarily O
trounced O
30 O
- O
20 O
in O
a O
game O
in O
which O
the O
score O
was O
closer O
than O
the O
actual O
game O
. O

That O
could O
very O
well O
happen O
Saturday O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
always O
tell O
people B-PER:Group
that O
the O
Georgia B-ORG:Sports
game O
matters O
more O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
than O
the O
Bama B-ORG:Sports
game O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
live O
in O
Georgia B-GPE:State-or-Province
, O
and O
losing O
that O
game O
affects O
me B-PER:Individual
much O
more O
directly O
than O
losing O
the O
Alabama B-ORG:Sports
game O
. O

That O
said O
, O
when O
kickoff O
time O
comes O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
remember O
all O
the O
reasons O
that O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
hate O
Alabama B-ORG:Sports
and O
their B-ORG:Sports
dumbass O
haircuts O
and O
their B-ORG:Sports
detergent O
and O
toilet O
paper O
and O
their B-ORG:Sports
houndstooth O
hats O
and O
their B-ORG:Sports
" O
Bear O
this O
" O
and O
" O
Bear O
that O
, O
" O
and O
everything O
else O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
it O
. O

This O
is O
n't O
a O
football O
game O
, O
and O
it O
's O
not O
two B-PER:Group
drunken I-PER:Group
cousins I-PER:Group
fighting I-PER:Group
at I-PER:Group
a I-PER:Group
family I-PER:Group
reunion I-PER:Group

This O
is O
brother B-PER:Individual

after O
one B-PER:Individual
slept O
with O
the B-PER:Individual
other I-PER:Individual
's I-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
and O
then O
bragged O
about O
it O
. O

However O
, O
when O
it O
's O
all O
said O
and O
done O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
just O
do O
n't O
think O
Alabama B-ORG:Sports
has O
the O
horses O
to O
stand O
up O
to O
what O
I B-PER:Individual
believe O
is O
going O
to O
be O
enormous O
defensive O
pressure O
. O

If O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
takes O
care O
of O
the O
ball O
and O
executes O
, O
this O
game O
should O
n't O
be O
as O
close O
as O
some O
think O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
feel O
so O
well O
... O

There O
's O
not O
" O
holiday O
" O
in O
this O
Holiday O
weekend O
... O

We B-PER:Group
have O
been O
on O
the O

since O
about O
noon O
on O
Wednesday O
and O
even O
longer O
in O
the B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
's O
case O
. O

She B-PER:Individual
started O
cleaning O
about O
a O
week O
before O
the O
holiday O
and O
cleaned O
for O
about O
two O
weeks O
right O
thru O
the O
holiday O
. O

We B-PER:Group
spent O
Friday O
doing O
a O
little O
shopping O
and O
got O
to O

early O
, O
but O
Saturday O
was O
busy O
with O
football O
watching O
. O

Not O
as O
a B-GPE:Nation
people I-GPE:Nation
, O
but O
as O
a B-ORG:Sports
football I-ORG:Sports
team I-ORG:Sports
. O

The B-ORG:Sports
looked O
good O
for O
15 O
minutes O
, O
but O
then O
they B-ORG:Sports
got O
run O
over O
by O
Matt B-PER:Individual
Leinert I-PER:Individual
and O
USC B-ORG:Sports
. O

I B-PER:Individual
have O
no O
beef O
with O
USC B-ORG:Sports
being O
number B-ORG:Sports
one I-ORG:Sports
, O
but O
Oklahoma B-ORG:Sports
is O
nowhere O
close O
to O

two I-ORG:Sports
in I-ORG:Sports
the I-ORG:Sports
country I-ORG:Sports
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
am O

only I-PER:Group
look I-PER:Group
at I-PER:Group
East I-PER:Group

instead I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
watching I-PER:Group
tape I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
games I-PER:Group
. O

Auburn B-ORG:Sports
has O
trailed O
in O
exactly O
two O
games O
this O
year O
, O
and O
has O
given O
up O
less O
than O
9.5 O
points O
per O
game O
. O

Oklahoma B-ORG:Sports
has O
given O
up O
bucketloads O
of O
points O
, O
but O
still O
gets O
some O
mystery O
respect O
for O
it O
. O

( O
I B-PER:Individual
know O
many B-PER:Group

the O
public O
eye O
where O
they B-PER:Group
admitted O
that O
they B-PER:Group
DID O
do O
steroids O

It O
seems O
that O
anyone B-PER:Individual

this I-PER:Individual
special I-PER:Individual
" I-PER:Individual
trainer I-PER:Individual
" I-PER:Individual
Greg I-PER:Individual

is O
coming O
up O
dirty O

It O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
that O
Major B-ORG:Sports
League I-ORG:Sports
Baseball I-ORG:Sports
has O
such O
a O
tough O
steroid O
policy O
, O
or O
this O
story O
may O
not O
have O
been O
brought O
to O
our B-PER:Group
attention O
. O

Never O
mind O
if O
the O
steroids O
and O
human B-PER:Group
growth O
hormones O
were O
illegal O
in O
baseball B-ORG:Sports
or O
not O
. O

They O
are O
illegal O
to O
use O
in O
the B-GPE:Nation
United I-GPE:Nation
States I-GPE:Nation
. O

I B-PER:Individual
want O
to O
know O
where O
the O
Federal O
criminal O
charges O
against O
all B-PER:Group
parties I-PER:Group
involved I-PER:Group
are O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
these B-PER:Group
guys I-PER:Group
( I-PER:Group
Sheff I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
Giambis I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
Marion I-PER:Group
Jones I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
Bonds I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
many I-PER:Group
others I-PER:Group
) O
are O
running O
around O
denying O
this O
shit O
and O
acting O
like O
Pete B-PER:Individual
Rose I-PER:Individual
did O
any O
time O
someone B-PER:Individual
asked O
him B-PER:Individual
about O
gambling O
( O
getting O
uber O
defensive O
, O
denying O
it O
implicitly O
and O
acting O
like O
the B-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
asking I-PER:Individual
had O
personally O
assaulted O
him B-PER:Individual
) O
is O
appalling O
. O

These B-PER:Group
clowns I-PER:Group
are O
messing O
with O
people B-PER:Group
's O
careers O
by O
insisting O
they B-PER:Group
're O
being O
lied O
about O
, O
yet O
when O
it O
turns O
out O
the B-PER:Group
reporters I-PER:Group
were O
n't O
lying O
and O
the B-PER:Group
athletes I-PER:Group
were O
, O
nothing O
is O
done O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
have O
never O
denied O
that O
Barry B-PER:Individual
Bonds I-PER:Individual
was O
a B-PER:Individual
special I-PER:Individual
and I-PER:Individual
gifted I-PER:Individual
athlete I-PER:Individual
. O

Whether O
it O
's O
steroids O
, O
HGH B-PER:Group
, O
crank O
, O
lighter O

or O
antifreeze O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
using O
, O
being O
able O
to O
perform O
at O
this O
level O
for O
this O
length O
of O
time O
defies O
logic O
or O
reason O
. O

That O
's O
why O
it O
's O
a O
shame O
that O
, O
in O
the O
final O
analysis O
, O
all O
of O
Bonds B-PER:Individual
' O
numbers O
and O
accomplishments O
are O
going O
to O
be O
ignored O
and O
lumped O
into O
the O
statement O
" O
yeah O
, O
but O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
on O
steroids O
. O
" O

It O
's O
a O
pity O
he B-PER:Individual
and O
the B-PER:Group
others I-PER:Group
are O
too O
dumb O
to O
see O
that O
. O

And O
now O
, O
just O
so O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
do O
n't O
think O
that O
every O
entry O
in O
this O
blog O
will O
be O
like O
the O
one O
above O
, O
here O
's O
a O
great O
joke O
I B-PER:Individual
read O
today O
: O

A B-PER:Individual
man I-PER:Individual
takes O
his B-PER:Individual
Rottweiler O
to O
the B-PER:Individual
vet I-PER:Individual
and O
says O
, O
" O
My B-PER:Individual
dog O
's O
cross O
-eyed O
, O
is O
there O
anything O
you B-PER:Individual
can O
do O
for O
him O
? O
" O

" O
Well O
, O
" O
says O
the B-PER:Individual
vet I-PER:Individual
, O
" O
let O
's B-PER:Indeterminate
have O
a O
look O
at O
him O
. O
" O

So O
he B-PER:Individual
picks O
the O
dog O
up O
and O
examines O
his O
eyes O
, O
then O
checks O
his O
teeth O
. O

Finally O
, O
the B-PER:Individual
vet I-PER:Individual
says O
" O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
going O
to O
have O
to O
put O
him O
down O
. O
" O

" O
No O
, O
because O
he O
's O
really O
heavy O
. O
" O

I B-PER:Individual
will O
be O
breaking O
down O
the O
SEC B-ORG:Sports
championship O
game O
either O
later O
today O
or O
tomorrow O
, O
so O
I B-PER:Individual
expect O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
all I-PER:Indeterminate
to O
be O
planted O
firmly O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
your B-PER:Indeterminate
seats O
waiting O
for O
that O
one O
. O

Hey O
, O
look O
who O
got O
screwed O
... O

I B-PER:Individual
am O
having O
a O
difficult O
time O
putting O
my B-PER:Individual
feelings O
into O
words O
right O
now O
, O
so O
bear O
with O
me B-PER:Individual
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
want O
to O
congratulate O
the B-ORG:Sports
Auburn I-ORG:Sports
Football I-ORG:Sports
team I-ORG:Sports
for O
doing O
what O
no B-ORG:Sports
other I-ORG:Sports
Auburn I-ORG:Sports

done O

They B-ORG:Sports
also O
won O
their B-ORG:Sports
first O
outright O
SEC B-ORG:Sports

since O
1987 O
and O
won O
their B-ORG:Sports
first O
SEC B-ORG:Sports

since O

. O

A O
year O
ago O
, O
the B-ORG:Sports
program I-ORG:Sports
was O
in O
disarray O
and O
the B-PER:Individual
coach I-PER:Individual
was O
one O
poorly O
executed O
plane B-VEH:Air
trip O
away O
from O
being O
fired O
by O
an B-PER:Individual
over I-PER:Individual
-zealous I-PER:Individual

too I-PER:Individual
empowered I-PER:Individual
booster I-PER:Individual
with I-PER:Individual
a I-PER:Individual
fat I-PER:Individual

Since O
that O
day O
, O
the B-ORG:Sports
team I-ORG:Sports
is O
undefeated O
and O
has O
won O
14 O
games O
in O
a O

They B-ORG:Sports
have O
now O
beated O
four B-ORG:Sports
teams I-ORG:Sports
that I-ORG:Sports
were I-ORG:Sports
in I-ORG:Sports
the I-ORG:Sports
top I-ORG:Sports
15 I-ORG:Sports
at I-ORG:Sports
the I-ORG:Sports
time I-ORG:Sports
the I-ORG:Sports
games I-ORG:Sports
were I-ORG:Sports
played I-ORG:Sports
, O
and O
two O
of O
those O

were O
won O

from O
Jordan B-FAC:Building-Grounds

On O

the B-ORG:Sports
big I-ORG:Sports
three I-ORG:Sports
all O
played O

USC B-ORG:Sports
won O
by O
five O
over O
a B-ORG:Sports
shitty I-ORG:Sports

with I-ORG:Sports
a I-ORG:Sports

5 I-ORG:Sports
record I-ORG:Sports
, O
and O
that O
was O
thanks O
in O
part O
to O
an B-PER:Individual
official I-PER:Individual
who I-PER:Individual
blew I-PER:Individual
dead I-PER:Individual
a I-PER:Individual
clear I-PER:Individual
and I-PER:Individual
obvious I-PER:Individual
fumble I-PER:Individual
that I-PER:Individual
would I-PER:Individual
have I-PER:Individual
been I-PER:Individual
returned I-PER:Individual
for I-PER:Individual
a I-PER:Individual
UCLA I-PER:Individual
touchdown I-PER:Individual
. O

Oklahoma B-ORG:Sports
played O
in O
it B-ORG:Sports
's O
conference B-ORG:Sports
title O
game O
against O
a B-ORG:Sports
four I-ORG:Sports
-loss I-ORG:Sports
Colorado I-ORG:Sports
team I-ORG:Sports
that I-ORG:Sports
ca I-ORG:Sports
n't I-ORG:Sports
throw I-ORG:Sports
the I-ORG:Sports
ball I-ORG:Sports
. O

The O
result O
was O
a O
40 O
plus O
point O
beatdown O
, O
but O
what O
did O
anyone B-PER:Individual
expect O
? O

Auburn B-ORG:Sports
played O
15th B-ORG:Sports
ranked I-ORG:Sports
Tennessee I-ORG:Sports
and O
was O
attempting O
to O
do O
one O
of O
the O
toughest O
things O
to O
do O
in O
college B-ORG:Educational
football O
: O
beating O
a B-ORG:Sports
team I-ORG:Sports
twice O
in O
the O
same O
year O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
15 O
yard O
shanked O
punt O
and O
a O
punt O
snap O
that O
Kody B-PER:Individual
Bliss I-PER:Individual
missed O
while O
having O
an O
apparent O
thrombosis O
, O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
led O
21 O
- O
7 O
at O
the O
half O
and O
had O
held O
UT B-ORG:Sports
to O
46 O
yards O
of O
offense O
. O

While O
the O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
running O
game O
was O
held O
up O
, O
Jason B-PER:Individual
Campbell I-PER:Individual
threw O
it O
all O
over O
the B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
ball I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
field I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
and O
, O
when O
his B-PER:Group
receivers I-PER:Group
were O
covered O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
ran O
for O
yardage O
on O
his B-PER:Individual
own I-PER:Individual
. O

This O
despite O
several O
late O
hits O
to O
the O
head O
, O
low O
hits O
at O
his B-PER:Individual
knees O
and O
ankles O
, O
and O
various O
other O
assaults O
outside O
the O
realm O
of O
good O
sportsmanship O
. O

Tennessee B-ORG:Sports
scored O
on O
a O
pass O
play O
that O
was O
incorrectly O
ruled O
a O
touchdown O
, O
since O
the O
ball O
clearly O
touched O
the O
turf O
, O
and O
that O
's O
where O
the O
momentum O
of O
the O
game O
changed O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
was O
also O
at O
that O
point O
that O
the O
scoreboard O
began O
to O
reflect O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
's O
last O
title O
hopes O
dying O
as O
the O
Oklahoma B-ORG:Sports
- O
Colorado B-ORG:Educational
score O
would O
have O
begun O
showing O
the O
beat O
- O
down O
that O
was O
occuring O
. O

Auburn B-ORG:Sports
was O
tied O
21 O
- O
21 O
and O
in O
jeapordy O
of O
losing O
it O
most O
important O
game O
ever O
, O
but O
senior B-PER:Individual
QB I-PER:Individual
Jason I-PER:Individual
Campbell I-PER:Individual
would O
have O
none O
of O
it O
. O

Auburn B-ORG:Sports
won O
going O
away O
38 O
- O
28 O
, O
and O
the O
only O
place O
the O
game O
looked O
close O
was O
on O
the O
scoreboard O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
an B-ORG:Sports
undefeated I-ORG:Sports
SEC I-ORG:Sports
team I-ORG:Sports
is O
not O
playing O
for O
a O
title O
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
we B-PER:Group
can O
thank O
Jeff B-PER:Group
Sagarin I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
other I-PER:Group
dicks I-PER:Group
that I-PER:Group
keep I-PER:Group
voting I-PER:Group
USC I-PER:Group
number I-PER:Group
one I-PER:Group
to I-PER:Group
make I-PER:Group
up I-PER:Group
for I-PER:Group
what I-PER:Group
happened I-PER:Group
to I-PER:Group
them I-PER:Group
last I-PER:Group
year I-PER:Group
. O

All O
I B-PER:Individual
know O
is O
that O
they B-PER:Group
better O
think O
that O
way O
next O
year O
, O
because O
it O
's O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
that B-ORG:Sports
got O
screwed O
this O
year O
. O

And O
what O
's O
better O
is O
that O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
gets O
to O
play O
one B-ORG:Sports
of I-ORG:Sports
the I-ORG:Sports
three I-ORG:Sports
hottest I-ORG:Sports
teams I-ORG:Sports
in I-ORG:Sports
the I-ORG:Sports
country I-ORG:Sports
in I-ORG:Sports
my I-ORG:Sports
opinion I-ORG:Sports
. O

Tech O
is O
talented O
, O
very O
athletic O
and O
one B-ORG:Sports
of I-ORG:Sports
the I-ORG:Sports
most I-ORG:Sports
well I-ORG:Sports
coached I-ORG:Sports
teams I-ORG:Sports
in I-ORG:Sports
the I-ORG:Sports
country I-ORG:Sports
and O
they B-ORG:Sports
WILL O
come O
to O
play O
on O
January O
3 O
rd O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
hope O
our B-ORG:Sports
kids I-ORG:Sports
can O
shake O
off O
this O
travesty O
and O
focus O
on O
making O
the B-PER:Group
pollsters I-PER:Group
look O
like O
idiots B-PER:Group
. O

Maybe O
an O
Oklahoma B-ORG:Sports
win O
in O
a O
butt O
-ugly O
game O
and O
a O
great O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
performance O
could O
help O
. O

What O
's O
the O
definition O
of O
pragmatic O
? O

Going O
undefeated O
and O
chanting O
" O
We B-PER:Group
're O
number O
TWO O
!! O
" O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
reading O
ESPN B-ORG:Media
this O
morning O
when O
I B-PER:Individual
stumbled O
across O
the O
story O
where O
Kobe B-PER:Individual
Bryant I-PER:Individual
said O
he B-PER:Individual
'd O
like O
to O
sit O
down O
with O
Shaq B-PER:Individual
and O
apologize O
to O
him B-PER:Individual
for O
" O
involving O
him B-PER:Individual
in O
my B-PER:Individual
troubles O
. O
" O

Bryant B-PER:Individual
also O
says O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
thinks O
December O
25th O
" O
sounds O
like O
a O
good O
day O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
to O
kind O
of O
talk O
to O
him B-PER:Individual
and O
tell O
him B-PER:Individual
I B-PER:Individual
never O
meant O
in O
any O
kind O
of O
way O
to O
bring O
any O
of O
his B-PER:Individual
personal O
business O
out O
. O
" O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
see O
, O
after O
Kobe B-PER:Individual
's O
world O
fell O
apart O
because O
he B-PER:Individual
could O
n't O
resist O
banging O
the B-PER:Individual
crazy I-PER:Individual
white I-PER:Individual
towel I-PER:Individual
clerk I-PER:Individual
at I-PER:Individual
his I-PER:Individual
hotel I-PER:Individual
, O
he B-PER:Individual
needed O
an O
out O
. O

He B-PER:Individual
bought O
his B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
a O
four B-Numeric:Money
million I-Numeric:Money
dollar I-Numeric:Money
ring O
and O
got O
some O
tattoos O
that O
said O
how O
much O
he B-PER:Individual
loved O
her B-PER:Individual
, O
but O
he B-PER:Individual
needed O
to O
do O
more O
to O
attract O
attention O
away O
from O
himself B-PER:Individual
. O

So O
he B-PER:Individual
told O
the B-ORG:Media
media I-ORG:Media
that O
he B-PER:Individual
should O
have O
done O
what O
Shaq B-PER:Individual
always O
did O
, O
just O
pay O
the B-PER:Group
women I-PER:Group
to O
shut O
up O
. O

Kobe B-PER:Individual
also O
alleged O
that O
O'neal B-PER:Individual
had O
paid O
upwards B-Numeric:Money
of I-Numeric:Money
one I-Numeric:Money
million I-Numeric:Money
dollars I-Numeric:Money
in O
this O
way O
as O
hush O
money O
over O
the O
years O
. O

Shaq B-PER:Individual
has O
denied O
it O
from O
the O
beginning O
, O
but O
that O
's O
not O
really O
the O
point O
. O

It O
's O
no O
secret O
that O
a O
large O
number O
of O
the B-PER:Group
NBA I-PER:Group
's I-PER:Group
" I-PER:Group
stars I-PER:Group
" O
are O
not O
exactly O
star-worthy O
. O

Good B-PER:Group
players I-PER:Group
or I-PER:Group
not I-PER:Group
, O
guys B-PER:Group
like I-PER:Group
Kemp I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
Bryant I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
Iverson I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
entire I-PER:Group
Blazers I-PER:Group
team I-PER:Group
are O
just O
not B-PER:Group
very I-PER:Group
nice I-PER:Group
or I-PER:Group
good I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
. O

If O
the B-ORG:Sports
league I-ORG:Sports
will O
tolerate O
it O
, O
what O
do O
I B-PER:Individual
care O
? O

But O
the O
real O
issue O
is O
this O
. O

Kobe B-ORG:Sports
's I-ORG:Sports
Lakers I-ORG:Sports
will O
play O
Shaq B-ORG:Sports
's I-ORG:Sports
Miami I-ORG:Sports
Heat I-ORG:Sports
on O
... O
that O
's O
right O
... O
December O
25th O
. O

So O
the O
real O
motivation O
for O
Kobe B-PER:Individual
here O
is O
not O
to O
mend O
fences O
or O
admit O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
wrong O
to O
involve O
any B-PER:Individual
other I-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
in O
his B-PER:Individual
own I-PER:Individual
little O
pit O
of O
woe O
. O

It O
is O
to O
find O
some O
sort O
of O
way O
to O
keep O
the B-PER:Individual
340 I-PER:Individual
- I-PER:Individual
pound I-PER:Individual
Shaquille I-PER:Individual
and O
his B-PER:Group
teammates I-PER:Group
from O
beating O
the O
ever O
- O
loving O
shit O
out O
of O
Kobe B-PER:Individual
for O
48 O
pain O
- O
filled O
minutes O
on O
Christmas O
Day O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
ca O
n't O
tell O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
the O
number O
of O
ways O
that O
Kobe B-PER:Individual
Bryant I-PER:Individual
makes O
me B-PER:Individual
sick O
. O

Despite O
his B-PER:Individual
slick O
talk O
and O
his B-PER:Individual
nice O
diction O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
nothing O
but O
a B-PER:Individual
cheater I-PER:Individual
and O
a B-PER:Individual
liar I-PER:Individual
and O
a B-PER:Individual
punk I-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
hardly O
watch O
any O
NBA B-ORG:Sports
games O
because O
the B-ORG:Sports
league I-ORG:Sports
and O
most B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
it I-PER:Group
's I-PER:Group
players I-PER:Group
sicken O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
but O

We B-PER:Group

busy O
with O
the O
holidays O
( O
that O

what O
we B-PER:Group
call O
December O
at O
our B-FAC:Building-Grounds
house I-FAC:Building-Grounds
) O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
just O
have O
n't O
had O
time O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
read O
a O
funny O
joke O
today O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
thought O
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
share O
it O
with O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
. O

One B-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
my I-PER:Individual
fellow I-PER:Individual
eggers I-PER:Individual
posted O
it O
, O
so O
Chet B-PER:Individual
, O
here O
's O
your B-PER:Individual
credit O
: O

A B-PER:Individual
traveler I-PER:Individual
was O
driving O
through O
Arkansas B-GPE:State-or-Province
when O
he B-PER:Individual
lost O
his B-PER:Individual
way O
and O
got O
off O
the B-FAC:Path
main I-FAC:Path
highway I-FAC:Path
. O

As O
he B-PER:Individual
drove O
by O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
saw O
rows B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
and I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
rows I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
of I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
pigsties I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
and I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
pigpens I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
and O
pigs O
running O
in O
fields B-LOC:Land-Region-Natural
and O
pigs O
wallowing O
in O
mud O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
his B-PER:Individual
eye O
caught O
something O
really O
strange O
. O

He B-PER:Individual
did O
a O
double O
take O
, O
muttered O
to O
himself B-PER:Individual
and O
then O
looked O
a O
third O
time O
. O

He B-PER:Individual
wondered O
if O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
seen O
correctly O
- O
it O
looked O
like O
a O
pig O
with O
a O
wooden O
leg O
! O

He B-PER:Individual
found O
the B-FAC:Path
lane I-FAC:Path
to I-FAC:Path
the I-FAC:Path
farm I-FAC:Path
and O
drove O
up O
into O
the B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
farmyard I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
, I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
where I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
he I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
was I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
met I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
by I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
the I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
farmer I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
. O

" O
Excuse O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
" O
the B-PER:Individual
traveler I-PER:Individual
said O
. O

" O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
just O
driving O
by O
and O
looking O
at O
all O
your B-PER:Indeterminate
pigs O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
noticed O
something O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
just O
had O
to O
stop O
and O
ask O
about O
. O

Tell O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
did O
I B-PER:Individual
see O
right O
? O

Is O
there O
really O
a O
pig O
out O
there O
with O
a O
wooden O
leg O
? O
" O

" O
Oh O
, O
that O
would O
be O
old O
Caesar O
you B-PER:Individual
saw O
. O

He O
's O
the O
finest O
pig O
a B-PER:Individual
man I-PER:Individual
could O
ever O
hope O
to O
have O
- O
and O
smart O
! O

Well O
, O
let O
me B-PER:Individual
tell O
you B-PER:Individual
a O
little O
about O
that O
pig O
. O

You B-PER:Individual
see O
that B-VEH:Water
barge I-VEH:Water
down I-VEH:Water
there I-VEH:Water
on I-VEH:Water
the I-VEH:Water
river I-VEH:Water
? O

That O
's O
a B-VEH:Water
mining I-VEH:Water
dredge I-VEH:Water
, I-VEH:Water
taking I-VEH:Water
out I-VEH:Water
platinum I-VEH:Water
ore I-VEH:Water
. O

Old O
Caesar O
sniffed O
out O
the O
vein O
and O
showed O
us B-PER:Group
how O
to O
set O
it O
up O
. O

Now O
that B-VEH:Water
dredge I-VEH:Water
brings O
me B-PER:Individual
in O
about O
$ B-Numeric:Money
120,000 I-Numeric:Money
every O
year O
. O

" O
There O
's O
another O
thing O
, O
too O
, O
a O
little O
more O
personal O
. O

One O
night O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
ago O
I B-PER:Individual
got O
to O
drinking O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
guess O
I B-PER:Individual
had O
more O
than O
I B-PER:Individual
should O
have O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
passed O
out O
drunk O
, O
fell O
down O
and O
knocked O
over O
a O
lamp O
. O

That O
started O
a O
fire O
in O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
house I-FAC:Building-Grounds
and O
old O
Caesar O
smelled O
the O
smoke O
. O

He O
came O
in O
the O
back O
door O
, O
got O
the B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
and O
kid B-PER:Individual
out O
, O
roused O
me B-PER:Individual
up O
and O
got O
me B-PER:Individual
out O
. O

" O
There O
is O
no O
question O
about O
it O
- O
that O
night O
old O
Caesar O
saved O
all O
our B-PER:Group
lives O
and O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
that O
is O
not O
the O
sort O
of O
thing O
a B-PER:Individual
man I-PER:Individual
is O
going O
to O
forget O
too O
easily O
. O
" O

" O
Why O
, O
" O
the B-PER:Individual
traveler I-PER:Individual
said O
, O
" O
this O
is O
all O
amazing O
! O

I B-PER:Individual
have O
never O
heard O
of O
a O
pig O
like O
this O
before O
! O

But O
tell O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
how O
did O
he O
get O
that O
wooden O
leg O
? O

Was O
he O
in O
a O
wreck O
or O
something O
? O
" O

The B-PER:Individual
farmer I-PER:Individual
laughed O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Well O
, O
naturally O
, O
when O
you B-PER:Individual
have O
a O
pig O
that O
smart O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
do O
n't O
want O
to O
eat O
him O
all O
at O
one O
time O
! O
" O

Did O
anyone O
see O
the O
Packers O
game O
Sunday O
? O

While O
it O
was O
entertaining O
, O
that O
's O
not O
why O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
posting O
about O
it O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
normally O
post O
about O
pro O
football O
, O
but O
what O
I B-PER:Individual
saw O
deserved O
a O
ranting O
or O
two O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
suspect O
it O
's O
going O
to O
get O
many O
more O
in O
the O
days O
and O
weeks O
to O
come O
. O

With O
4:41 O
left O
in O
the O
fourth O
quarter O
and O
the B-ORG:Sports
Packers I-ORG:Sports
down O
by O
11 O
, O
Favre B-PER:Individual
hit O
Robert B-PER:Individual
Ferguson I-PER:Individual
with O
a O
31 O
yard O
strike O
near O
the O
left O
hash O
marks O
. O

Coming O
from O
the O
other O
direction O
, O
Jacksonville B-PER:Individual
DB I-PER:Individual
Donovin I-PER:Individual
Darius I-PER:Individual
unloaded O
chin O
high O
on O
Ferguson B-PER:Individual
with O
a O
vicious O
clothesline O
. O

Ferguson B-PER:Individual
held O
on O
to O
the O
ball O
, O
despite O
being O
disjoined O
from O
his B-PER:Individual
helmet O
on O
the O
hit O
. O

After O
many O
minutes O
lying O
motionless O
on O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
field I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
Ferguson B-PER:Individual
was O
finally O
removed O
via O
stretcher O
, O
giving O
a O
thumbs O
up O
to O
the B-PER:Group
crowd I-PER:Group
on O
the O
way O
out O
. O

The B-ORG:Sports
Packers I-ORG:Sports
went O
on O
to O
lose O
the O
game O
, O
but O
that O
's O
not O
the O
story O
here O
. O

This O
was O
not O
one O
of O
the O
staged O
stiff O
- O
armed O
clotheslines O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
see O
in O
professional O
wrestling O
broadcasts O
. O

This O
was O
a O
vicious O
, O
arm O
cocked O
and O
swinging O
clothesline O
that O
literally O
could O
have O
torn O
Ferguson B-PER:Individual
's O
head O
off O
of O
his B-PER:Individual
body O
. O

The O
play O
was O
immediately O
flagged O
, O
and O
moments O
later O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
Darius B-PER:Individual
had O
been O
ejected O
, O
much O
to O
the B-PER:Group
crowd I-PER:Group
's O
delight O
. O

One O
sidenote O
here O
is O
that O
, O
despite O
their B-PER:Group
rabid O
fandom O
and O
the O
situation O
, O
not O
one O
thing O
was O
thrown O
at O
the B-PER:Individual
offending I-PER:Individual
player I-PER:Individual
as O
he B-PER:Individual
left O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
field I-FAC:Building-Grounds
. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
easy O
to O
bathe O
him B-PER:Individual
in O
beer O
or O
snowballs O
or O
batteries O
as O
he B-PER:Individual
left O
, O
but O
the B-PER:Group
Packer I-PER:Group
fans I-PER:Group
are O
classier O
than O
that O
. O

To O
a B-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
, O
they B-PER:Group
acted O
with O
class O
, O
using O
their B-PER:Group
voices O
and O
not O
projectiles O
to O
express O
their B-PER:Group
displeasure O
. O

This O
was O
the O
most O
vicious O
and O
blatantly O
dirty O
play O
I B-PER:Individual
have O
seen O
in O
the B-ORG:Sports
NFL I-ORG:Sports
since O
Jim B-PER:Individual
McMahon I-PER:Individual
was O
body O
slammed O
to O
the O
ground O
in O
the O
mid O
80 O
's O
about O
five O
seconds O
after O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
released O
a O
pass O
. O

And O
Jaguars B-PER:Individual
coach I-PER:Individual
Jack I-PER:Individual
Del I-PER:Individual
Rio I-PER:Individual
and O
Darius B-PER:Individual
had O
the O
nerve O
to O
vociferously O
argue O
with O
officials B-PER:Group
about O
Darius B-PER:Individual
' O
ejection O
from O
the O
game O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
care O
what O
anyone B-PER:Indeterminate
says O
about O
" O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
ca O
n't O
judge O
intent O
. O
" O

Darius B-PER:Individual
' O
intent O
was O
to O
dismember O
, O
injure O
or O
even O
kill O
Ferguson B-PER:Individual
. O

The O
more O
I B-PER:Individual
saw O
the O
replay O
, O
the O
sicker O
it O
made O
me B-PER:Individual
feel O
. O

The B-ORG:Sports
league I-ORG:Sports
must O
take O
action O
, O
and O
it O
must O
be O
swift O
and O
sure O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
talking O
about O
a O
four O
game O
suspension O
that O
included O
the O
playoffs O
if O
necessary O
. O

In O
this O
day O
and O
age O
of O
bigger B-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
stronger I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
faster I-PER:Group
players I-PER:Group
, O
injuries O
are O
going O
to O
happen O
accidentally O
all O
of O
the O
time O
. O

There O
is O
simply O
no O
room O
for O
the O
kind O
of O
play O
that O
resulted O
in O
Ferguson B-PER:Individual
's O
injury O
. O

Paul B-PER:Individual
Tagliabue I-PER:Individual
must O
give O
word O
to O
all B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
his I-PER:Group
employees I-PER:Group
that O
actions O
like O
this O
will O
not O
be O
tolerated O
. O

Maybe O
that O
will O
tell O
the B-ORG:Sports
Jaguars I-ORG:Sports
, O
Darius B-PER:Individual
and O
players B-PER:Group
like I-PER:Group
him I-PER:Group
that O
this O
kind O
of O
head O
- O
hunting O
will O
not O
be O
tolerated O
in O
the B-ORG:Sports
NFL I-ORG:Sports
. O

If O
not O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
fully O
expect O
the B-ORG:Sports
Packers I-ORG:Sports
and O
many B-ORG:Sports
other I-ORG:Sports
teams I-ORG:Sports
to O
handle O
this O
matter O
" O
on O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
field I-FAC:Building-Grounds
" O
with O
Darius B-PER:Individual
being O
the B-PER:Individual
target I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
similar I-PER:Individual
attacks I-PER:Individual
by I-PER:Individual
tight I-PER:Individual
ends I-PER:Individual
and I-PER:Individual
offensive I-PER:Individual

I O
forgot O
to O

you O
this O

Mark B-PER:Individual
Backer I-PER:Individual
2005-01-03T08:29:00 O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
on O
vacation O
from O
December O
23rd O
until O
today O
, O
January O
3rd O
. O

It O
's O
tough O
to O
come O
back O
to O
work O
after O
being O
gone O
for O
ten O
days O
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
tougher O
to O
stay O
home B-FAC:Building-Grounds
and O
try O
to O
do O
what O
my B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
does O
every O
day O
, O
which O
is O
work O
, O
raise O
our B-PER:Individual
daughter I-PER:Individual
, O
keep O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
house I-FAC:Building-Grounds
, O
cook O
, O
and O
everything O
else O
. O

Now O
, O
the O
thing O
I B-PER:Individual
forgot O
to O
tell O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
was O
that O
when O
I B-PER:Individual
walked O
out O
of O
the B-FAC:Building-Grounds
office I-FAC:Building-Grounds
to O
go O
home B-FAC:Building-Grounds
on O
the O
23rd O
, O
there O
was O
a O
pink O
post O
it O
on O
my B-VEH:Land
car I-VEH:Land
. O

Call O
me B-PER:Individual
Joyce B-PER:Individual

_ O
_ O
_ O
_ O
_ O
_ O

I B-PER:Individual
am O
happy O
she B-PER:Individual
left O
the O
note O
and O
took O
responsibility O
for O
it O
, O
but O
what O
in O
the O
fuck O
is O
going O
on O
that O
every O
couple O
of O
months O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
taking O
cars B-VEH:Land
to O
the B-ORG:Commercial
shop I-ORG:Commercial
for O
things O
that O
are O
not O
my B-PER:Individual
fault O
? O

This O
is O
the O
third O
incident O
in O
15 O
months O
, O
and O
two O
of O
the O
three O
involved O
other B-PER:Group
folks I-PER:Group
hitting O
my B-VEH:Land
parked I-VEH:Land
cars I-VEH:Land
!! O

I B-PER:Individual
knew O
my B-PER:Individual
20 O
year O

would O
end O
sometime O
, O
but O
do O
the O
karma O

Gods O
have O
to O
beat O
me B-PER:Individual
over O
the O
head O
with O
a O
shovel O
about O
it O
? O

So O
today O
I B-PER:Individual
had O
Enterprise B-ORG:Commercial
pick O
me B-PER:Individual
up O
at O
7:15 O
, O
which O
was O
great O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
was O
worried O
about O
being O
late O
to O
work O
and O
, O
as O
it O
turned O
out O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
only O
16 O
minutes O

I B-PER:Individual
was O
given O
a O
choice O
between O
a B-VEH:Land
taurus I-VEH:Land
and O
an B-VEH:Land
impala I-VEH:Land
. O

I B-PER:Individual
made O
the O
wrong O
choice O
. O

loyalty O
. O

season O
is O
finally O
over O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
am O
a O
bit O
sad O
because O
years O
like O
this O
only O
happen O
for O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
every O
15 O
or O
20 O
years O
, O
so O
it O
's O
a O
little O
disappointing O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
this O
worked O
out O
about O
as O
well O
as O
it O
could O
. O

If O
you B-ORG:Sports

In O

Oklahoma B-ORG:Sports
has O
played O
in O
four O
huge O
games O
, O
and O
lost O
three O
of O
them O
... O
badly O
. O

That O
must O
feel O
like O
being O
a B-PER:Individual
Sox I-PER:Individual
fan I-PER:Individual
before O
this O
year O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
imagine O
. O

A O
year O
ago O
, O
Tuberville B-PER:Individual
was O
one B-PER:Individual
reporter I-PER:Individual
's O
abililty O
to O
find O
an B-VEH:Air
out I-VEH:Air
of I-VEH:Air
place I-VEH:Air

in I-VEH:Air
Ohio I-VEH:Air
away O
from O
being O
fired O
BEFORE O
the O
Alabama B-ORG:Sports

. O

Then O
, O
the B-PER:Individual
AD I-PER:Individual
and I-PER:Individual
President I-PER:Individual
get O
canned O
, O
a B-PER:Individual
booster I-PER:Individual
starts O
down O
the O

to O

, O
and O
Tuberville B-PER:Individual
keeps O
smiling O
and O
saying O
the O
right O
things O
. O

He B-PER:Individual
talks O
his B-PER:Group
two I-PER:Group
running I-PER:Group

and I-PER:Group
two I-PER:Group
stellar I-PER:Group
DB I-PER:Group

into O
staying O
, O
then O
knocks O
out O
15 O

wins O
and O
signs O
one O
of O
those O
super O
iron O

contracts O
that O

pay O
him B-PER:Individual
14 B-Numeric:Money
million I-Numeric:Money
over O
seven O
years O
, O
and O
if O
Auburn B-ORG:Sports
even O
thinks O
... O
THINKS O
about O
letting O
him B-PER:Individual
go O
, O
they B-ORG:Sports
owe O
him B-PER:Individual
every B-Numeric:Money
penny I-Numeric:Money
. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
even O
think O
there O
's O
a O
morality O
clause O
. O

He B-PER:Individual
could O
have O
sex O
with O
an O
endangered O
Bald O
Eagle O
, O
and O
they B-ORG:Sports
'd O
STILL O
have O
to O
pay O
him B-PER:Individual
. O

And O
that O
's O
the O
way O
it O
should O
be O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
Auburn B-PER:Group
fans I-PER:Group
can O
spend O
the O
next O
six O
months O
saying O
" O
yeah O
, O
but O
we B-ORG:Sports
'd O
have O
done O
this O
" O
or O
" O
We B-ORG:Sports
were O
13 O
- O
0 O
, O
won O
the O
sec O
, O
beat O
five B-ORG:Sports
top I-ORG:Sports
ten I-ORG:Sports
teams I-ORG:Sports
, O
three B-ORG:Sports
of I-ORG:Sports
them I-ORG:Sports
on O
the B-FAC:Path
road I-FAC:Path
, O
and O
became O
the B-ORG:Sports
only I-ORG:Sports
undefeated I-ORG:Sports
SEC I-ORG:Sports
team I-ORG:Sports
in I-ORG:Sports
the I-ORG:Sports
BCS I-ORG:Sports
's I-ORG:Sports
history I-ORG:Sports
to I-ORG:Sports
NOT I-ORG:Sports
play I-ORG:Sports
for I-ORG:Sports
the I-ORG:Sports
title I-ORG:Sports
. O
" O

And O
coincidentally O
, O
Oklahoma B-ORG:Sports
's O
played O
in O
it O
this O
year O
, O
last O
year O
, O
and O
in O
2000 O
. O

You B-ORG:Sports
won O
in O
2000 O
, O
but O
you B-ORG:Sports
got O
punked O
the O
last O
two O
years O
, O
and O
last O
year O
you B-ORG:Sports
got O
to O
play O
for O
the O
title O
even O
though O
you B-ORG:Sports
did O
n't O
even O
win O
your B-ORG:Sports
conference I-ORG:Sports
. O

You B-ORG:Sports
got O
embarassed O
by O
Kansas B-ORG:Sports
State I-ORG:Sports
and O
LSU B-ORG:Sports
last O
year O
, O
and O
humiliated O
this O
year O
. O

But O
the B-ORG:Sports
little I-ORG:Sports
12 I-ORG:Sports
is O
SOOO O
much O
better O
than O
the B-ORG:Sports
SEC I-ORG:Sports
. O

That O
's O
why O
you B-ORG:Sports
played O
a B-ORG:Sports
four I-ORG:Sports
-loss I-ORG:Sports
team I-ORG:Sports
for O
your B-ORG:Sports
conference B-ORG:Sports
title O
this O
year O
. O

And O
, O
considering O
the B-ORG:Sports
BCS I-ORG:Sports
is O
run O
by O
the B-PER:Individual
head I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
Big I-PER:Individual
12 I-PER:Individual
, O
it O
's O
no O
wonder O
you B-ORG:Sports
get O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
doubt O
. O

How O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
only B-ORG:Sports
two I-ORG:Sports
teams I-ORG:Sports
that I-ORG:Sports
did I-ORG:Sports
n't I-ORG:Sports
win I-ORG:Sports
their I-ORG:Sports
conference I-ORG:Sports
have O
ever O
played O
for O
the O
national O
title O
? O

You B-ORG:Sports
and O
Nebraska B-ORG:Sports
in O
2001 O
. O

Oh O
, O
the O
other O
thing O
you B-ORG:Sports
two I-ORG:Sports
Big I-ORG:Sports
12 I-ORG:Sports
teams I-ORG:Sports
have O
in O
common O
is O
that O
you B-ORG:Sports
got O
your B-ORG:Sports
asses O
kicked O
on O
the O
sport O
's O
biggest O
stage O
. O

So O
yes O
, O
we B-PER:Group
are O
disappointed O
. O

But O
all O
you B-ORG:Sports
can O
do O
is O
play O
the O
schedule O
in O
front O
of O
you B-ORG:Sports
. O

Auburn B-ORG:Sports
did O
that O
with O
class O
and O
dignity O
, O
they B-ORG:Sports
won O
every O
game O
, O
faced O
down O
every O
challenge O
, O
and O
made O
every B-PER:Group
Auburn I-PER:Group

the I-PER:Group
country I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
world I-PER:Group
proud O
. O

Now O
, O
can O
someone B-PER:Individual
get O
the B-PER:Group
Auburn I-PER:Group
cheerleaders I-PER:Group
some O
of O
those O
USC B-ORG:Sports

? O

Much O
like O
the O
" O
I B-PER:Individual
told O
you B-PER:Individual
so O
's O
" O
everyone B-PER:Group
is O
throwing O
at O
the B-ORG:Sports
UGA I-ORG:Sports
basketball I-ORG:Sports
program I-ORG:Sports
after O
their B-ORG:Sports
hiring O
and O
subsequent O
firing O
of O
The B-PER:Group
Harricks I-PER:Group
, O
folks B-PER:Group
around I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
Buckeye I-PER:Group
state I-PER:Group
have O
to O
be O
having O
similar O
thoughts O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
AD B-PER:Individual
and I-PER:Individual
frequent I-PER:Individual
" I-PER:Individual
No I-PER:Individual
we I-PER:Individual
did I-PER:Individual
n't I-PER:Individual
" I-PER:Individual
Ohio I-PER:Individual

Andy I-PER:Individual
Geiger I-PER:Individual
is O
" O
retiring O
" O
after O
11 O
years O
at O
the O
helm O
. O

Maybe O
it O
's O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
guessing O
Andy B-PER:Individual
's O
tired O
of O
putting O
on O
TV O
makeup O
and O
going O
on O
the O
news O
lying O
about O
what O
he B-PER:Individual
or O
Tressel B-PER:Individual
knew O
about O
their B-PER:Group
athletes I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
general I-PER:Group
and O
their B-ORG:Sports
football I-ORG:Sports
program I-ORG:Sports
in I-ORG:Sports
particular I-ORG:Sports
. O

It O
seems O
that O
Maurice B-PER:Individual
Clarrett I-PER:Individual
- O
gate O
just O
is O
n't O
going O
away O
. O

Two O
years O
ago O
, O
everyone B-PER:Group
was O
saying O
" O
shame O
on O
you B-PER:Individual
, O
Maurice B-PER:Individual
. O

You B-PER:Individual
should O
have O
known O
better O
. O
" O

Now O
, O
it O
seems O
like O
most B-PER:Group
folks I-PER:Group
are O
saying O
" O
Shame O
on O
you B-PER:Group
both I-PER:Group
Andy B-PER:Individual
and O
Jim B-PER:Individual
. O

YOU B-PER:Group
both I-PER:Group
should O
have O
know O
better O
. O
" O

Allegations O
have O
come O
to O
light O
that O
several B-PER:Group
OSU I-PER:Group
players I-PER:Group
received O
illegal O
benefits O
including O
cash O
, O
access O
to O
cars B-VEH:Land
, O
etc O
. O

Now O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
expect O
the B-PER:Individual
AD I-PER:Individual
and I-PER:Individual
coach I-PER:Individual
to O
know O
everything O
, O
but O
when O
a B-PER:Individual
player I-PER:Individual
is O
driving O
a B-VEH:Land
brand I-VEH:Land
new I-VEH:Land
car I-VEH:Land
every O
couple O
of O
weeks O
or O
months O
, O
well O
, O
somebody B-PER:Individual
ought O
to O
jot O
a O
memo O
and O
get O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
that O
. O

It O
should O
n't O
surprise O
Buckeye B-PER:Group
fans I-PER:Group
either O
, O
since O
Tressel B-PER:Individual
had O
similar O
problems O
at O
Youngstown B-ORG:Educational
State I-ORG:Educational
, O
and O
left O
a O
wake O
of O
controversy O
behind O
himself B-PER:Individual
there O
as O
well O
, O
including O
( O
surprise O
) O
illegal O
benefits O
including O
cash O
, O
cars B-VEH:Land
, O
grade O
fixing O
, O
etc O
. O

Geiger B-PER:Individual
is O
also O
tired O
from O
saying O
" O
we B-PER:Group
did O
n't O
do O
anything O
wrong O
" O
about O
his B-ORG:Sports
basketball I-ORG:Sports
program I-ORG:Sports
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
discovered O
that O
his B-PER:Individual
men I-PER:Individual
's I-PER:Individual
basketball I-PER:Individual
coach I-PER:Individual
had O
directly O
given O
six B-Numeric:Money
grand I-Numeric:Money
to O
a B-PER:Individual
Yugoslavian I-PER:Individual
recruit I-PER:Individual
, O
but O
that O
was O
just O
his B-PER:Individual
stipend O
for O
travel O
and O
coach B-PER:Individual
Jim I-PER:Individual
O'Brien I-PER:Individual
was O
just O
having O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
currency O
exchange O
rates O
... O
right O
Andy B-PER:Individual
? O

I B-PER:Individual
only O
hope O
that O
the B-ORG:Sports
NCAA I-ORG:Sports
will O
do O
something O
they B-ORG:Sports
rarely O
do O
: O
make O
a O
good O
sound O
decision O
and O
take O
away O
Ohio B-ORG:Sports
State I-ORG:Sports
's O
national O
title O
from O
January O
2003 O
. O

It O
seems O
they B-ORG:Sports
had O
a B-PER:Individual
very I-PER:Individual
important I-PER:Individual
and I-PER:Individual
very I-PER:Individual
ineligible I-PER:Individual
player I-PER:Individual
that O
season O
, O
and O
maybe O
many B-PER:Group
. O

I B-PER:Individual
'd O
hate O
to O
give O
another O
title O
to O
Thugtown B-ORG:Sports
Miami I-ORG:Sports
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
give O
it O
to O
Alabama B-ORG:Sports
before O
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
think O
it O
was O
okay O
for O
Ohio B-ORG:Sports

to O
keep O

Gary O
Bettman O
announced O
the O
cancellation O
of O
the O
2004-2005 O
NHL B-ORG:Sports
season O
. O

As O
if O
everyone B-PER:Group
did O
n't O
already O
know O
that O
was O
the O
case O
. O

Shame O
on O
the B-ORG:Sports
NHL I-ORG:Sports
and O
shame O
on O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
players I-ORG:Non-Governmental
' I-ORG:Non-Governmental
association I-ORG:Non-Governmental
for O
not O
getting O
a O
deal O
done O
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
put O
much O
more O
of O
the O
blame O
on O
the B-PER:Group
owners I-PER:Group
as O
this O
" O
negotiation O
" O
came O
down O
to O
the O
wire O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
understand O
that O
the B-ORG:Sports
league I-ORG:Sports
was O
losing O
less O
money O
by O
not O
playing O
than O
it B-ORG:Sports
would O
have O
by O
having O
a O
season O
this O
year O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
also O
understand O
that O
when O
push O
came O
to O
shove O
, O
the B-PER:Group
players I-PER:Group
gave O
in O
and O
accepted O
a O
salary O
cap O
. O

Okay O
, O
the B-PER:Group
sides I-PER:Group
were O
about O
7 B-Numeric:Money
million I-Numeric:Money
per O
team B-ORG:Sports
apart O
, O
but O
could O
n't O
they B-PER:Group
just O
say O
" O
alright O
, O
let O
's B-PER:Group
split O
that O
in O
half O
and O
play O
hockey O
? O
" O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
Holy B-PER:Individual
Christ I-PER:Individual
people B-PER:Group
, O
two B-PER:Group
kids I-PER:Group
arguing I-PER:Group
over I-PER:Group
10 I-PER:Group
bucks I-PER:Group
would O
work O
it O
out O
that O
way O
. O

Why O
is O
this O
any O
different O
? O

The B-ORG:Sports
NHL I-ORG:Sports
's O
primary O
goal O
was O
to O
get O
a O
salary O
cap O
approved O
by O
the B-PER:Group
players I-PER:Group
, O
and O
they B-ORG:Sports
finally O
did O
. O

And O
what O
did O
the B-ORG:Sports
NHL I-ORG:Sports
do O
when O
that O
momentus O
event O
occurred O
? O

They B-ORG:Sports
left O
the O
negotiating O
table O
. O

Gary B-PER:Individual
Bettman I-PER:Individual
is O
a B-PER:Individual
mindless I-PER:Individual
troll I-PER:Individual
and O
the B-PER:Individual
professional I-PER:Individual
sports I-PER:Individual
commissioner I-PER:Individual
equivalent I-PER:Individual

fuck O
is O
the B-LOC:Land-Region-Natural

. O

The O
first O
thing O
that O
needs O
to O
happen O
is O
that O
Bettman B-PER:Individual
and O
Goodenow B-PER:Individual
( O
the B-PER:Individual
players I-PER:Individual
' I-PER:Individual
association I-PER:Individual
rep I-PER:Individual
) O
need O
to O
be O
fired O
, O
deported O
, O
flogged O
, O
tarred O
and O
feathered O
and O
finally O
forced O
to O

four O

a O

four O

an B-FAC:Building-Grounds

for O
every O
day O
of O
the O
next O

so O
they B-PER:Group
understand O
what O
the B-PER:Group
fans I-PER:Group
go O
thru O
to O
see O
a O
hockey O
game O
. O

Then O
, O
all O
current O
contracts O
need O
to O
be O
voided O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O

in O
2006 O
. O

That O
means O
no B-ORG:Sports

would O
own O
any B-PER:Individual

the B-PER:Group

to O
the O
fear O
that O
the B-ORG:Commercial
company I-ORG:Commercial
may O
go O
the O
conglomerate B-ORG:Commercial
route O
. O

They B-ORG:Commercial
have O
many O

of O

late I-ORG:Commercial

A O

that O

substantially O
reduce O
the O

of O

I B-PER:Individual

the O

I B-PER:Individual
do O

see O
the O

As O
a B-ORG:Commercial
retailer I-ORG:Commercial
of I-ORG:Commercial
just I-ORG:Commercial
about I-ORG:Commercial
everything I-ORG:Commercial

WalMart B-ORG:Commercial

expand O

either O
their B-ORG:Commercial
core O
competencies O
or O
some O

where O
they B-ORG:Commercial
can O
cut O
costs O
. O

After O
all O
, O
adding O
some O
international O
shipping O

to O
their B-ORG:Commercial

would O
be O
a O
natural O

Ellison B-PER:Individual
is O
brilliant O
enough O
to O
make O
this O

he B-PER:Individual

crazy O
enough O
to O
wreck O
even O

One O
of O
the O
rules O
of O
thumb O
that O
has O
guided O
my B-PER:Individual
( O
limited O
) O
business O
career O
from O
the O
beginning O
is O
that O
China B-GPE:Nation
is O
never O
as O
lucrative O
as O
it B-GPE:Nation
looks O
. O

This O
assumption O
is O
based O
on O
about O
150 O
years O
of O
economic O
history O
, O
including O
several O
booms O
in O
interest O
and O
investment O
in O
China B-GPE:Nation

And O
now O
it O
's O
an O

- O

since O
there O
are O

and O
the B-PER:Group
labor I-PER:Group

is O
n't O
quite O
so O
expendable O
. O

What O
they B-GPE:Nation
've O
been O
missing O
for O
years O
was O
the O
real O
driver O
behind O
any O
consumer B-PER:Group
economy O
: O
Consumers B-PER:Group
. O

Specifically O
, O
they B-GPE:Nation
did O
n't O
have O
a B-PER:Group
real I-PER:Group
middle I-PER:Group
class I-PER:Group
. O

That O
's O
changed O
in O
the O
last O
twenty O
years O
, O
as O
increasing O
social O
mobility O
and O
a O
burst O
in O
foreign O
demand O
has O
finally O
made O
China B-GPE:Nation
a B-GPE:Nation
genuine I-GPE:Nation
, I-GPE:Nation
rather I-GPE:Nation
than I-GPE:Nation
theoretical I-GPE:Nation
, I-GPE:Nation
contender I-GPE:Nation
. O

And O
they B-GPE:Nation
've O
even O
supplied O

that O
they B-GPE:Nation
've O

If O
only O
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
figured O
this O
out O
in O

when O

for O
whatever O
reason O
, O
is O
n't O
worthwhile O
to O
consumers B-PER:Group
. O

But O
it O
's O
important O
to O
remember O
that O
the O
status O
quo O
is O
never O
more O
than O
a O
snapshot O
-- O
investing O
as O
though O
it O
's O
permanent O
is O
a O
recipe O
for O
disaster O
. O

According O
to O
the O
usually B-ORG:Media
reliable I-ORG:Media
CNN I-ORG:Media
/ O
Money O
, O
the O
" O
Twin O
Deficits O
" O
will O
continue O
to O
grow O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
believe O
they B-ORG:Media
're O
referring O
to O
the O
budget O
deficit O
and O
... O
the O
capital O
surplus O
? O

When O
analyzing O
trade O
deficits O
, O
it O
's O
important O
to O
realize O
that O
the O
amount O
by O
which O
imports O
exceed O
exports O
is O
also O
equal O
to O
the O
net O
amount O
foreign B-PER:Group
investors I-PER:Group
have O
bet O
on O
the B-GPE:Nation
US I-GPE:Nation
. O

So O
the O
trade O
deficit O
is O
due O
to O
a O
confluence O
of O
the O
pressures O
from O
US B-PER:Group
consumers I-PER:Group
( I-PER:Group
who I-PER:Group
control I-PER:Group
about I-PER:Group
20 I-PER:Group
% I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
global I-PER:Group
GDP I-PER:Group
) O
and O
everybody B-PER:Group
else I-PER:Group
( O
excluding O
the O
non-consumption O
share O
of O
US B-GPE:Nation
GDP O
, O
that O
would O
amount O
to O
around O
75 B-Numeric:Percent
% I-Numeric:Percent
of O
global O
GDP O
) O
. O

Which O
of O
those O
is O
-- O
probably O
-- O
going O
to O
be O
a O
more O
important O
number O
? O

Even O
if O
we B-GPE:Nation
are O
consumers B-GPE:Nation
bent I-GPE:Nation
on I-GPE:Nation
gorging I-GPE:Nation
ourselves I-GPE:Nation
with I-GPE:Nation
imported I-GPE:Nation
goods I-GPE:Nation
, O
the O
largest O
pressure O
on O
the O
deficit O
is O
that O
we B-GPE:Nation
're O
simply O
a B-GPE:Nation
better I-GPE:Nation
place I-GPE:Nation
for I-GPE:Nation
investment I-GPE:Nation
-- O
higher O
returns O
on O
capital O
in O
developing B-GPE:Nation
countries I-GPE:Nation
are O
more O
than O
mitigated O
by O
the O
higher O
political O
risks O
they B-GPE:Nation
face O
. O

And O
what O
about O
that O
other O
deficit O
? O

It O
, O
of O
course O
, O
is O
the O
ominous O
sum O
that O
we B-GPE:Nation
fund O
without O
taxes O
, O
but O
by O
borrowing O
funds O
. O

And O
about O
half O
of O
those O
borrowings O
end O
up O
with O
the B-ORG:Commercial
major I-ORG:Commercial
banks I-ORG:Commercial
in I-ORG:Commercial
Asia I-ORG:Commercial
. O

So O
, O
not O
to O
be O
a O
heretic O
, O
but O
1 O
) O
We B-GPE:Nation
're O
issuing O
them O
at O
relatively O
low O
interest O
rates O
, O
2 O
) O
Inflation O
is O
bound O
to O
pick O
up O
eventually O
, O
and O
so O
3 O
) O
Would O
n't O
you B-PER:Individual
rather O
have O
our B-GPE:Nation
deficits O
made O
up O
by O
economically O
nonsensical O
purchases O
by O
non B-PER:Group
-US I-PER:Group
investors I-PER:Group
, O
rather O
than O
raising O
taxes O
in O
America B-GPE:Nation
? O

It O
's O
a O
question O
of O
who B-PER:Indeterminate
will O
pay O
for O
the O
same O
spending O
, O
and O
all O
else O
being O
equal O
I B-PER:Individual
'd O
be O
happy O
for O
Asian B-ORG:Commercial

to O
pick O
up O
the O

. O

The O
Twin O
Deficits O
are O
a O
reality O
, O
but O
they O
are O
n't O
exactly O
a O
terrifying O
one O
. O

At O

I B-PER:Individual
was O
pretty O
skeptical O
of O
Gmail O

an O

of O
something O
new O

cool O
, O

free O
, O
from O
a B-ORG:Commercial
quirky I-ORG:Commercial

, O
on O
April O

Turns O
out O
my B-PER:Individual
initial O
attitude O
was O
n't O
justified O
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
Gmail O
has O
been O
a O
popular O
success O
. O

Just O
this O
weekend O
, O
Google B-ORG:Commercial
gave O
many B-PER:Group
users I-PER:Group
another O
fifty O
invitations O
, O
prompting O
some B-PER:Group
to O
speculate O
that O
it O
could O
be O
the O
start O
of O
Gmail O
's O
final O
move O
out O
of O
beta O
. O

Their B-ORG:Commercial
marketing O
was O
absolutely O
brilliant O
: O

Simply O
through O
association O
with O
Google B-ORG:Commercial
, O
and O
because O
of O
the O
invitation O
- O
only O
membership O
, O
they B-ORG:Commercial
created O
a O
product O
with O
instant O
cachet O
-- O
something O
so O
in O
demand O
invitations O
went O
for O
$ B-Numeric:Money
50 I-Numeric:Money
on O
eBay B-ORG:Commercial
, O
and O
one O
enterprising O

even O
offered O
a O

an O

Everyone B-PER:Group

wants I-PER:Group

an O
almost O
pathological O
desire O

It O

a O

the O

does O

mean O
much O
in O
the O
early O
days O

it O

Clearly O

their B-ORG:Commercial

: O

In O

Lucas I-LOC:Celestial
, O
he B-PER:Individual
portrays O
a O
benevolent O

( O
or O
benevolent O

) O
as O
being O
superior O
to O
a O

, O
with O
the O
democracy O
being O
the O
system O
rife O
with O

bloat O
. O

With O
Greenspan B-PER:Individual
's O
unspoken O
position O
as O
economic B-PER:Individual
czar I-PER:Individual
, O
that O
's O
what O
we B-PER:Group
have O
right O
now O
: O
a O
benevolent O
dictatorship O
of O
the B-ORG:Government
Fed I-ORG:Government
. O

But O
one O
of O
the O
why O
dictatorships O
are O
so O
inferior O

is O
that O
democracy O
offers O
a O
stable O

Will O
we B-PER:Group

that O
at O

the O

( O

( O
AARP B-ORG:Non-Governmental

The O
battle O
is O

Where O
will O
Dr. B-PER:Individual

come O
down O
in O

? O

What O
will O
he B-PER:Individual
say O
on O

and O
the O
associated O
costs O
with O
implementing O
such O
a O
system O
? O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
'll O
have O
a O
pretty O
big O
impact O
on O
what O
happens O
next O
... O

I B-PER:Individual
ca O
n't O
tell O
you O
how O
much O
I B-PER:Individual
want O
to O
take O
sides O
here O

but O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
trying O
to O
keep O
my B-PER:Individual
political O

out O

I B-PER:Individual

really O
hate O

alienate O
half B-PER:Group
my I-PER:Group
political I-PER:Group

So O
I B-PER:Individual
'll O
just O
note O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
see O
it O
as O
quite O
so O
black O

white O

and O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
some O
of O
the O
compromises O
( O
like O

on O
the O
grounds O
that O

It O

a O
great O
summary O
of O
the O
paradoxes O
of O
the O
Russian B-GPE:Nation
economy O
: O

They B-GPE:Nation
have O
a O
huge O
untapped O
supply O
of O
valuable O
IT O
labor O
, O
but O
their B-GPE:Nation
IT O

only O
a O
tenth O

and O
only O
a O
thirtieth O
of O
India B-GPE:Nation

. O

They B-GPE:Nation
develop O
lots O
of O
new O
technology O
, O
but O
nobody B-PER:Indeterminate
can O
tell O
who B-PER:Indeterminate
owns O
what O
. O

And O
, O
of O
course O
, O
their B-GPE:Nation
securities O

are O
even O
flimsier O
than O

I B-PER:Individual
can O
think O
of O
only O
one O
good O
reason O
to O
be O
this O
enthusiastic O
about O
Martha B-ORG:Commercial
Stewart I-ORG:Commercial
Living I-ORG:Commercial
: O

The O
fact O
that O
so B-PER:Group
many I-PER:Group
investors I-PER:Group
are O
so O
clearly O
enthusiastic O
about O
Martha B-ORG:Commercial
Stewart I-ORG:Commercial
Living I-ORG:Commercial
. O

There O
are O
few O
worse O
times O
to O
buy O
a O
stock O
than O
when O
the B-PER:Individual
namesake I-PER:Individual
and I-PER:Individual
guiding I-PER:Individual
force I-PER:Individual
behind I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
company I-PER:Individual
is O
in O
prison B-FAC:Building-Grounds
( O
whether O
or O
not O
she B-PER:Individual
really O
should O
be O
) O
, O
advertising O
is O
down O
by O
nearly O
half O
, O
and O
the O
brand O
has O
been O
tarnished O
beyond O
recognition O
. O

And O
yet O
the O
stock O
's O
within O
a O
few O
points O
of O
an O
all O
- O
time O
high O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
Russian B-GPE:Nation
legal O
system O
is O
a O
bit O
less O
, O
well O
, O
legalistic O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
seem O
much O
more O
concerned O
about O
the O
chance O
that O
someone B-PER:Individual
will O
harm O
the B-GPE:Nation
state I-GPE:Nation
than O
about O
actual O
matters O
of O
right O
and O
wrong O
. O

So O
it O
's O
pretty O
significant O
that O
Mikhail B-PER:Individual
Khodorkovsky I-PER:Individual
is O
taking O
the O
risk O
of O
maintaining O
his B-PER:Individual
innocence O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
has O
essentially O
no O
chance O
of O
recovering O
anything O
, O
unless O
Russia B-GPE:Nation
sees O
a O
change O
in O
political O
control O
and O
the B-GPE:Nation
US I-GPE:Nation
applies O
some O
pressure O
. O

We B-PER:Group
all O
know O
by O
now O
that O
Choicepoint B-ORG:Commercial
allowed O
some B-PER:Group
highly I-PER:Group
respectable I-PER:Group
Nigerian I-PER:Group
businessmen I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
impeccable I-PER:Group
credentials I-PER:Group
to O
view O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
customer B-PER:Group
records O
for O
entirely O
legitimate O
purposes O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
were O
paying B-PER:Group
customers I-PER:Group
, O
after O
all O
, O
and O
The B-PER:Individual
Customer I-PER:Individual
is O
Always O
Right O
. O

But O
even O
after O
that O
huge O
mistake O
-- O
or O
rather O
, O
because O
of O
it O
-- O
the B-PER:Group
company I-PER:Group
's I-PER:Group
top I-PER:Group
executives I-PER:Group
began O
dumping O
shares O
like O
mad O
. O

What O
's O
scary O
is O
that O
since O
they B-PER:Group
started O
selling O
, O
the O
stock O
's O
down O
about B-Numeric:Percent
5 I-Numeric:Percent
% I-Numeric:Percent
. O

Clearly O
, O
they B-PER:Group
were O
expecting O
lots O
more O
damage O
. O

These O
insider O
sales O
were O
certainly O
stupid O
, O
and O
probably O
criminal O
( O
though O
the O
legal O
proof O
may O
be O
hard O
to O
come O
by O
) O
but O
the O
solution O
is O
easy O
enough O
: O

They B-PER:Group
need O
to O
buy O
stock O
from O
the B-ORG:Commercial
company I-ORG:Commercial
itself I-ORG:Commercial
, O
at O
some O
premium O
to O
the O
prices O
at O
which O
they O
sold O
-- O
they B-PER:Group
'll O
have O
the O
same O
stake O
as O
before O
, O
the B-PER:Group
shareholders I-PER:Group
would O
have O
gotten O
their B-PER:Group
money O
back O
( O
since O
the O
premium O
goes O
to O
the B-ORG:Commercial
company I-ORG:Commercial
, I-ORG:Commercial
which I-ORG:Commercial
is I-ORG:Commercial
owned I-ORG:Commercial
by I-ORG:Commercial
the I-ORG:Commercial
shareholders I-ORG:Commercial
) O
, O
and O
there O
's O
no O
need O
to O
disrupt O
their B-PER:Group
business O
by O
taking O
the O
matter O
to O
court B-ORG:Government

Or O
, O
if O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
want O
to O
do O
things O

Southern O
states O
considering O
higher O
cigarette O
taxes O
? O

Good O
plan O
; O
cigarettes O
impose O
pretty O
high O
penalties O
on O
states B-GPE:State-or-Province
, O
inasmuch O
as O
the B-GPE:State-or-Province
states I-GPE:State-or-Province
are O
caretakers B-GPE:State-or-Province
for I-GPE:State-or-Province
plenty I-GPE:State-or-Province

ill I-GPE:State-or-Province
thanks I-GPE:State-or-Province
to I-GPE:State-or-Province
cigarettes I-GPE:State-or-Province
. O

What O
's O
notable O
in O
this O
debate O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
according O
to O
MSN B-ORG:Commercial
Moneycentral I-ORG:Commercial
, O
tobacco B-PER:Group
executives I-PER:Group
are O
attacking O
the O
tax O
by O
noting O
that O
" O
While O
North B-GPE:State-or-Province
Carolina I-GPE:State-or-Province
's O
excise O
tax O
is O
only O
5 B-Numeric:Money
cents I-Numeric:Money
, O
the O
total O
taxes O
given O
to O
North B-GPE:State-or-Province
Carolina I-GPE:State-or-Province
by O
smokers B-PER:Group
adds O
up O
to O
more O
than O
61 B-Numeric:Money
cents I-Numeric:Money
per O
pack O
. O
" O

Okay O
, O
okay O
-- O
since O
the B-ORG:Commercial
tobacco I-ORG:Commercial
companies I-ORG:Commercial
pay O
lots O
of O
money O
to O
the B-GPE:State-or-Province
states I-GPE:State-or-Province
, O
that O
's O
technically O
accurate O
. O

But O
the O
point O
of O
these O
taxes O
is O
to O
align O
the O
price O
of O
a O
pack O
with O
the O
cost O
to O
society B-PER:Group
, O
and O
inasmuch O
as O
these O
penalties O
are O
n't O
assessed O
on O
a O
per-pack O
basis O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
-- O
they O
're O
a O
lump O
- O
sum O
reflection O
of O
the O
taxes O
these B-ORG:Commercial
companies I-ORG:Commercial
ought O
to O
have O
paid O
before O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
policy O
of O
making O
cigarette B-PER:Group
buyers I-PER:Group
pay O
to O
compensate O
society B-PER:Group
for O
the O
costs O
they B-PER:Group
impose O
is O
a O
politically O
palatable O
synthesis O
of O
the O
unpalatable O
notion O
of O
simply O
refusing O
treatment O
unless O
they B-PER:Group
pay O
full O
cost O
. O

They B-PER:Group
're O
basically O
buying O
future O
medical O
care O
throughout O
their B-PER:Group
lives O
, O
rather O
than O
eventually O
making O
the B-PER:Group
( I-PER:Group
healthy I-PER:Group
) I-PER:Group
remainder I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
populace I-PER:Group
pay O
up O
. O

You B-PER:Individual
'd O
think O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
busy O
enough O
with O
Blockbuster B-ORG:Commercial
and O
Hollywood B-ORG:Commercial
, O
but O
Carl B-PER:Individual
Icahn I-PER:Individual
is O
once O
again O
going O
after O
Mylan B-ORG:Commercial
labs I-ORG:Commercial
. O

I B-PER:Individual
'd O
love O
to O
call O
it O
a O
classic O
raid O
-- O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
making O
an O
offer O
for O
the B-ORG:Commercial
company I-ORG:Commercial
, O
nominating O
his B-PER:Group
own I-PER:Group
board I-PER:Group
, O
claiming O
management B-PER:Group
can O
accept O
one O
or O
the O
other O
or O
both O
, O
and O
hinting O
that O
if O
they B-PER:Group
paid O
him B-PER:Individual
enough O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
'd O
probably O
go O
away O
. O

But O
the O
whole O
point O
of O
raiding O
is O
to O
outsmart O
an B-PER:Individual
opponent I-PER:Individual
, O
and O
that O
means O
the O
strategy O
changes O
constantly O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
most O
interesting O
twist O
is O
that O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
shorting O
shares O
of O
Mylan B-ORG:Commercial
's I-ORG:Commercial
acquisition I-ORG:Commercial
target I-ORG:Commercial
, O
King B-ORG:Commercial
Pharmaceuticals I-ORG:Commercial
; O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
basically O
doubling O
down O
on O
the O
bet O
that O
they B-ORG:Commercial
wo O
n't O
acquire O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
if O
Mylan B-ORG:Commercial
bought O
him B-PER:Individual
out O
, O
they B-ORG:Commercial
'd O
have O
less O
money O
to O
fund O
a O
purchase O
of O
King B-ORG:Commercial
Pharmaceuticals I-ORG:Commercial
. O

Either O
way O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
's O
showing O
a O
lot O
of O
confidence O
. O

Given O
his B-PER:Individual
record O
, O
it O
's O
warranted O
. O

Who O
will O
lead O
the O
revolution O
? O

For O
my B-PER:Individual
holiday O
post O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
offer O
a O
message O
of O
hope O
for O
the O
business O
world O
. O

In O
1994 O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
a B-PER:Individual
graduate I-PER:Individual
student I-PER:Individual
in I-PER:Individual
Boston I-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
was O
asked O
to O
moderate O
a O
panel O
discussion O
on O
social O
entrepreneurship O
for O
a O
conference O
at O
Harvard B-ORG:Educational
Business I-ORG:Educational

The O
conference O
was O
being O
held O
by O
a B-ORG:Non-Governmental
new I-ORG:Non-Governmental

called I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Students I-ORG:Non-Governmental
for I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Responsible I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Business I-ORG:Non-Governmental
. O

I B-PER:Individual
expected O
to O
see O
a B-PER:Group
small I-PER:Group
gathering I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
idealistic I-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
slightly I-PER:Group
naive I-PER:Group
MBA I-PER:Group
students I-PER:Group
. O

What O
I B-PER:Individual
found O
was O
a B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
packed I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
room I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
of I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
200 I-FAC:Subarea-Facility

These B-PER:Group

were O
determined O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
use O
business O
as O
a O
driver O
for O
positive O
social O
change O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
left O
that B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
room I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
with O
my B-PER:Individual
eyes O
open O
to O
the O
possibilities O
presented O
by O

Approximately B-PER:Group
900 I-PER:Group

attended O
the O
2004 O

The O
buzz O

included O
social O

I B-PER:Individual
met O
student B-PER:Individual

intent O
on O
harnessing O
the O
forces O
of O
business O
and O
capitalism O
to O
improve O
the B-LOC:Celestial

These B-PER:Group

understand O
that O

a O

in O
this B-LOC:Celestial

Recently O
business B-ORG:Educational

have O
received O
their B-ORG:Educational
share O
of O
criticism O
for O
turning O
out O

I B-PER:Individual
can O
tell O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
that O
I B-PER:Individual
am O
seeing O
a O
powerful O
groundswell O
of O
change O
coming O

or O
the B-ORG:Government

The O

is O

A O
little O
secret O
of O

is O
that O

two B-PER:Group

Both B-PER:Group

the B-PER:Group

wo O

preference O
until O
his B-PER:Individual
departure O
, O
when O
it B-PER:Group
opens O
a O

Perhaps O
this O
is O
a O
good O
time O
for O
a O
quick O
refresher O
.... O

The B-PER:Individual
CEO I-PER:Individual
works O
for O
the B-PER:Group
board I-PER:Group
...end O
lesson O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
guess O
it O
is O
not O
as O
straight O
forward O
when O
your B-PER:Individual
CEO I-PER:Individual
is O
also O
chairman B-PER:Individual
and O
one B-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
largest I-PER:Individual
shareholders I-PER:Individual
. O

It O
would O
be O
tempting O
to O
get O
on O
my B-PER:Individual
high O
horse O
right O
now O
about O
the O
need O
to O
separate O
the O
positions O
of O
CEO B-PER:Individual
and O
Chairman B-PER:Individual
but O
to O
be O
honest O
with O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
really O
believe O
that O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
know O
CEO B-PER:Individual
/ O
chair B-PER:Individual
duality O
is O
a O
popular O
cause O
for O
corporate O
governance O
. O

However O
there O
is O
little O
empirical O
evidence O
to O
suggest O
that O
separating O
these O
roles O
affects O
firm O
performance O
in O
either O
a O
positive O
or O
negative O
way O
. O

Having O
a B-PER:Individual
combined I-PER:Individual
CEO I-PER:Individual
/ I-PER:Individual
Chairman I-PER:Individual
does O
reduce O
the O
ability O
of O
the B-PER:Group
board I-PER:Group
to O
act O
as O
a O
check O
on O
management B-PER:Group
and O
this O
does O
mean O
that O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
need O
to O
be O
more O
critical O
in O
your B-PER:Indeterminate
assessment O
of O
the O
trustworthiness O
of O
the B-PER:Group
top I-PER:Group
management I-PER:Group
team I-PER:Group
. O

This O
downside O
of O
having O
a B-PER:Individual
combined I-PER:Individual
CEO I-PER:Individual
/ I-PER:Individual
chair I-PER:Individual
is O
offset O
by O
( O
1 O
) O
a O
reduction O
of O
coordination O
and O
communication O
costs O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
organization O
and O
( O
2 O
) O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
negotiating O
position O
of O
the B-PER:Individual
CEO I-PER:Individual
when O
dealing O
with O
suppliers B-ORG:Commercial
, O
potential B-ORG:Commercial

partners I-ORG:Commercial
, O
etc O
. O

# O

could O
be O
particularly O
useful O
in O
a O
dynamic O

. O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
however O
look O
more O
carefully O
at O
the B-PER:Group
top I-PER:Group
management I-PER:Group
team I-PER:Group

a I-PER:Group

Chair I-PER:Group
before O
investing O

It O
is O
important O
that O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
can O
get O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
trustworthiness O
of O
the B-PER:Individual

Is O

high O
turnover O
among O
senior B-Job-Title

If O

I B-PER:Individual
also O
look O
at O
the O
performance O
of O

I B-PER:Individual

Making O
this O

is O
certainly O
a O
source O

It O
can O

be O

Should O

This O

often O
these O

the O

The O
only O
way O

is O
by O

information O
may O
still O
be O
useful O
even O
after O

It O
might O
also O
be O
useful O
to O
look O
at O

about O
their B-ORG:Commercial
inclusion O
on O
this O

Search O
the O
news O

and O
see O
if O
in O
the O
past O
year O
the B-ORG:Commercial
company I-ORG:Commercial
did O
anything O
that O
might O
have O
totally O
pissed O

not O
by O

an B-ORG:Commercial

who B-PER:Indeterminate
knows O
what O

So O
I B-PER:Individual
will O
thankfully O
accept O
the O

bemoan O
the O
loss O

these I-ORG:Commercial
things I-ORG:Commercial

I B-PER:Individual
am O
confident O
that O
they B-ORG:Commercial
have O
changed O
their B-ORG:Commercial
standard O
business O
practices O

It O
may O
take O
a O
couple O
years O

and O
several O
more O
financial O
filings O

on O
time O
of O

, O
before O
I B-PER:Individual
am O
persuaded O
to O
take O
a O
second O
look O
at O
the B-ORG:Commercial
company I-ORG:Commercial
. O

The O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
rely O
on O
SEC B-ORG:Government
filings O
to O
assess O
companies B-ORG:Commercial
and O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
want O
to O
have O
any O
doubt O
about O
the O
veracity O
of O
the O
information O
contained O
in O
these O
documents O

In O
Nortel B-ORG:Commercial
's O
defense O
, O
they B-ORG:Commercial
have O
just O
gone O
through O
the O
perfect O
storm O
in O
the B-ORG:Commercial
telecommunications I-ORG:Commercial
equipment I-ORG:Commercial
sector I-ORG:Commercial
. O

The B-ORG:Commercial
whole I-ORG:Commercial
industry I-ORG:Commercial
overbuilt O
and O
got O
blindsided O
by O
the O
tech O
downturn O
. O

This O
could O
be O
described O
as O
a B-ORG:Commercial
growth I-ORG:Commercial
industry I-ORG:Commercial
that I-ORG:Commercial
went I-ORG:Commercial
on I-ORG:Commercial
a I-ORG:Commercial
bender I-ORG:Commercial
and I-ORG:Commercial
is I-ORG:Commercial
now I-ORG:Commercial
trying I-ORG:Commercial
to I-ORG:Commercial
recover I-ORG:Commercial
from I-ORG:Commercial
the I-ORG:Commercial
hangover I-ORG:Commercial
. O

I B-PER:Individual
've O
always O
felt O
that O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
learn O
a O
lot O
about O
someone B-PER:Individual
when O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
see O
how O
they B-PER:Individual
try O
to O
recover O
from O
a O
hangover O
( O
pause O
for O
brief O
college B-ORG:Educational
flashback O
) O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
time O
to O
assess O
organizational O
effectiveness O
in O
the B-ORG:Commercial
telecommunications I-ORG:Commercial
equipment I-ORG:Commercial
industry I-ORG:Commercial
. O

Nortel B-ORG:Commercial
and O
Lucent B-ORG:Commercial
attempted O
to O
hide O
the O
damage O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
drunk O
! O
) O
and O
hope O
for O
an O
uptick O
in O
demand O
before O
they B-ORG:Commercial
would O
have O
to O
come O
clean O
. O

Both B-ORG:Commercial
companies I-ORG:Commercial
have O
been O
penalized O
for O
these O
actions O
and O
have O
continued O
to O
restructure O
operations O
, O
sell O
assets O
, O
and O
layoff O
employees B-PER:Group
. O

Cisco B-ORG:Commercial
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
was O
able O
to O
take O
one O
huge O
restructuring O
charge O
in O
2001 O
and O
move O
forward O
. O

Their B-ORG:Commercial
ability O
to O
do O
this O
and O
have O
it O
work O
( O
so O
far O
) O
indicates O
a O
very O
deep O
and O
impressive O
understanding O
of O
their B-ORG:Commercial
organization O
. O

Especially O
when O
compared O
to O
its B-ORG:Commercial
competitors I-ORG:Commercial
, O
Cisco B-ORG:Commercial
seems O
to O
be O
back O
in O
fighting O
form O
due O
to O
it B-ORG:Commercial
's I-ORG:Commercial
ability O
to O
rapidly O
assess O
its B-ORG:Commercial
organizational O
structure O
and O
reconfigure O
to O
meet O
the O
changing O
market O

Not O
bad O
for O
a B-ORG:Commercial
company I-ORG:Commercial
with I-ORG:Commercial

The O
reaction O
that O

most O
amusing O
is O
the O

I B-PER:Individual
do O
not O

into O
the O

debate O
here O
or O
argue O
the O

of O
Atlas O

Those O
discussions O
, O
though O
interesting O
, O
avoid O
a O
simpler O
question O
. O

Do O
measures O
of O
corporate O
social O
responsibility O
contain O
valuable O
added O
information O
that O

, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
've O
probably O
heard O
the O
standard O
answer O
-- O
the O
evidence O
is O
mixed O
. O

That O
is O
true O
but O
not O
very O
revealing O
would O
n't O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
say O
? O

Evidence O
is O
mixed O
mostly O
because O
( O
1 O
) O
there O
is O
little O
agreement O
about O
how O
to O
measure O
social O
responsibility O
and O
( O
2 O
) O
many O
current O
measures O
toss O
together O
a O
heap O
of O
information O
that O
has O
no B-ORG:Commercial
business I-ORG:Commercial
being O
lumped O
together O
. O

Social O
responsibility O
often O
includes O
everything O
from O
treatment O
of O
employees B-PER:Group
to O
type O
of O
product O
produced O
. O

There O
is O
not O
really O
any O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
selling O
guns B-WEA:Shooting
or O
tobacco O
has O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
forcing O
employees B-PER:Group
to O
work O
unpaid O
overtime O
. O

Yet O
both O
get O
lumped O
together O
in O
the O
socially O
responsible O
investing O
discussion O
. O

Once O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
start O
to O
break O
apart O
social O
responsibility O
into O
its O
various O
components O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate

information O

Yesterday O
was O
a O
tough O
day O
for O
the O
Seattle B-GPE:Population-Center
scene O
. O

Amazon B-ORG:Commercial
ended O
the O
day O
down O
14.6 B-Numeric:Percent
% I-Numeric:Percent
. O

I B-PER:Individual
should O
disclose O
that O
I B-PER:Individual
spent O
a O
few O
years O
living O
in O
Seattle B-GPE:Population-Center
and O
I B-PER:Individual
have O
a O
soft O
spot O
in O
my B-PER:Individual
heart O
for O
all O
things O
Seattle B-GPE:Population-Center
. O

As O
far O
as O
I B-PER:Individual
could O
tell O
, O
many B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
Northwest I-PER:Group
spend O
the O
mornings O
drinking O
lattes O
and O
their O
evenings O
drinking O
microbrews O
. O

Really O
not O
a O
bad O
lifestyle O
. O

Anyway O
, O
back O
on O
topic O
here O
. O

Both B-ORG:Commercial
companies I-ORG:Commercial
have O
pricey O
stocks O
and O
those O
valuations O
are O
based O
on O
optimistic O
expectations O
of O
future O
growth O
. O

Yesterday O
's O
news O
led O
many B-PER:Group
to O
question O
their B-PER:Group
growth O
assumptions O
for O
these B-ORG:Commercial
companies I-ORG:Commercial
. O

Today O
I B-PER:Individual
want O
to O
talk O
a O
bit O
about O
Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
I B-PER:Individual
have O
to O
start O
by O
acknowledging O
that O
the O
stock O
is O
still O
pricey O
even O
after O
its O
drop O
yesterday O
. O

However O
, O
my B-PER:Individual
organizational O
indicators O
analysis O
reveals O
a O
very O
low O
level O
of O
business O
risk O
. O

This O
may O
partially O
justify O
a O
higher O
P/E O
ratio O
. O

A O
couple O
weeks O
ago O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
observed O
that O
Wal B-ORG:Commercial
- I-ORG:Commercial
Mart I-ORG:Commercial
had O
offsetting O
strong O
and O
weak O
organizational O
indicators O
. O

Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
has O
uniformly O
strong O
organizational O
indicators O
. O

Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
scores O
as O
best O
in O
its B-ORG:Commercial
industry O
on O
six O
of O
seven O
organizational O
indicators O
. O

Not O
surprising O
are O
its B-ORG:Commercial
strong O
scores O
in O
the O
employee B-PER:Group
relations O
and O
stakeholder B-PER:Individual
actions O
indicators O
. O

It B-ORG:Commercial
s O
weakest O
score O
is O
in O
the O
external O
reporting O
indicator O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
several B-PER:Group
observers I-PER:Group
have O
raised O
concerns O
about O
aggressive O
accounting O
at O
Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
but O
my B-PER:Individual
analysis O
does O
not O
indicate O
any O
systematic O
current O
issues O
. O

The O
weak O
score O
is O
primarily O
the O
result O
of O
Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
current O
strategy O
of O
increasing O
equity O
ownership O
of O
several B-ORG:Commercial
foreign I-ORG:Commercial
subsidiaries I-ORG:Commercial
. O

This O
is O
a O
strategic O
shift O
that O
has O
short O
- O
term O
costs O
and O
adds O
some O
uncertainty O
to O
the O
financial O
statements O
. O

Beyond O
the O
strong O
Organizational O
Indicator O
analysis O
, O
several O
additional O
factors O
favor O
Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
ability O
to O
continue O
to O
grow O
revenues O
. O

1 O
. O
Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
has O
little O
debt O
. O

Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
is O
not O
currently O
financing O
its B-ORG:Commercial
growth O
with O
debt O
. O

Considering O
its B-ORG:Commercial
growth O
, O
this O
is O
amazing O
. O

It O
also O
means O
that O
Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
has O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
flexibility O
in O
how O
it B-ORG:Commercial
finances O
future O
growth O
. O

The B-ORG:Commercial
company I-ORG:Commercial
can O
assume O
much O
more O
debt O
without O
negatively O
affecting O
it B-ORG:Commercial
s O
risk O
profile O
because O
... O

Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
has O
a O
healthy O
cashflow O
and O
current O
cash O
position O
. O

This O
allows O
the B-ORG:Commercial
company I-ORG:Commercial
to O
grow O
without O
debt O
. O

You B-PER:Indeterminate
could O
argue O
that O
Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
has O
too O
much O
cash O
and O
should O
do O
more O
to O
pass O
it O
on O
to O
shareholders B-PER:Group
. O

This O
option O
is O
another O
way O
that O
Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
has O
retained O
its B-ORG:Commercial
flexibility O
for O
the O
future O
. O

3 O
. O
Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
is O
the B-ORG:Commercial
primary I-ORG:Commercial
owner I-ORG:Commercial
of I-ORG:Commercial
its I-ORG:Commercial
stores I-ORG:Commercial
and O
limits O
franchising O
. O

While O
Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
does O
partner O
( O
airlines B-ORG:Commercial
, O
airports B-FAC:Airport
, O
Barnes B-ORG:Commercial
& I-ORG:Commercial
Noble I-ORG:Commercial
) I-ORG:Commercial
, I-ORG:Commercial
most B-FAC:Building-Grounds
of I-FAC:Building-Grounds
its I-FAC:Building-Grounds
stores I-FAC:Building-Grounds
are O
company B-ORG:Commercial
owned O
. O

From O
a O
managerial O
perspective O
this O
greatly O
simplifies O
cost O
structures O
, O
product O
changes O
, O
and O
quality O
control O
. O

Taken O
together O
all O
of O
these O
factors O
paint O
a O
picture O
of O
a O
company O
with O
a O
very O
strong O
future O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
can O
not O
say O
if O
these O
factors O
justify O
the O
current O
share O
price O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
would O
say O
that O
they O
justify O
a O
higher O
P/E O
ratio O
than O
the O
industry O
norm O
. O

Interesting O
aside O
: O
Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
is O
taking O
over O
the O
location O
in O
my B-GPE:Population-Center
town I-GPE:Population-Center
that B-FAC:Building-Grounds
was O
recently O
abandoned O
by O
Krispy O
Kreme O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
this O
writing O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
not O
own O
Starbucks B-ORG:Commercial
stock O
... O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
am O
tempted O
and O
might O
consider O
a O
buy O

crisis O
that O

perpetrated O
on O
America B-GPE:Nation

it O
? O

Another O
one O
of O
your B-PER:Individual

This O
is O
a O
medical O

Over B-PER:Group
80,000 I-PER:Group
Americans I-PER:Group

220 B-PER:Group
every O

die O
from O
medical O

, O
hundred B-PER:Group

And O
the B-ORG:Commercial

which I-ORG:Commercial
had I-ORG:Commercial
relatively I-ORG:Commercial
steady I-ORG:Commercial

its B-ORG:Commercial

, O
its B-ORG:Commercial
interest O

, O
the O

collapse O
down O
. O

And O
so O
they B-ORG:Commercial
're O
jacking O
up O
the O
rates O
on O
a O
few O
key O
specialties O
like O
obstetricians B-PER:Group

But O
if O
you B-PER:Indeterminate

the O
entire O

that O
's O
paid O
by O
doctors B-PER:Group

this I-PER:Group
country I-PER:Group
to O

insurers I-ORG:Commercial
and O
divide O
it O
evenly O
, O
they B-PER:Group
'd O
be O
paying O
less B-Numeric:Money
than I-Numeric:Money
$ I-Numeric:Money
9,000 I-Numeric:Money

That O
's O
one O
- O
third O
of O
what O
they B-PER:Group
pay O
a B-PER:Individual

That O
runs O
against O
the O
fact O
that O
so B-PER:Group
many I-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
them I-PER:Group
are O
just O
leaving O
their B-PER:Group

you B-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual
often O
agree O

one O
thing O

our B-PER:Individual

Well O
, O
the O
current O
medical O
liability O
system O
is O
affecting O
patients B-PER:Group
in O
that O
they B-PER:Group
ca O
n't O
get O
access O
to O

. O

The B-ORG:Medical-Science
American I-ORG:Medical-Science
Medical I-ORG:Medical-Science
Association I-ORG:Medical-Science
works O
very O
hard O
to O
make O
safety O
a O
priority O
in O
the O
medical O
care O
system O
. O

That O
's O
why O
we B-ORG:Medical-Science
founded O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
National I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Patient I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Safety I-ORG:Non-Governmental
Foundation I-ORG:Non-Governmental

The O
current O
system O
does O
n't O
measure O
negligence O

And O
what O
we B-ORG:Medical-Science
're O
finding O
now O
is O
that O
the B-ORG:Medical-Science
emergency I-ORG:Medical-Science
rooms I-ORG:Medical-Science
are O
closing O
, O
trauma B-ORG:Medical-Science

Another B-PER:Individual
witness I-PER:Individual
today O
told O
of O
what O
happened O
to O
her B-PER:Individual
husband I-PER:Individual
because O
there O
were O
no O
longer O
neurosurgeons B-PER:Group
available I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
community I-PER:Group
. I-PER:Group

The B-PER:Individual
patient I-PER:Individual
had O
to O
be O
airavacked O
and O
by O
that O
time O
it O
was O
too O
late O
to O
prevent O
the O
brain O
damage O
. O

Those O
are O
important O
points O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
do O
n't O
doubt O
. O

But O
I B-PER:Individual
wonder O
if O
you B-PER:Individual
can O
respond O
to O
Mr. B-PER:Individual
McCormick I-PER:Individual

point O
. O

Who B-PER:Individual
are O
you B-PER:Individual
, I-PER:Individual
who B-PER:Individual
's O
our B-PER:Individual
president I-PER:Individual
to O
tell O
him B-PER:Individual
that O
his B-PER:Individual
suffering O
is O
only O
worth O
$ O
250,000 B-Numeric:Money
for O
the O
loss O
of O
a B-PER:Individual
child I-PER:Individual
? I-PER:Individual

Well O
, O
what O
has O
to O
be O
done O
here O
is O
balance O
. O

What O
we B-GPE:Nation
need O
is O
a O
system O
that O
's O
fair O
to O
everyone B-PER:Group
, I-PER:Group
a O
system O
that O
keeps O
the B-PER:Group
physicians I-PER:Group

and O
allows O
patients B-PER:Group
to O
have O
access O
to O
physicians B-PER:Group
in O
their B-PER:Group
hour O
of O

And O
the O

, O
that O

a O

It O
brought O
stability O
to O
California B-GPE:State-or-Province

do O
you B-PER:Individual

underestimated O
the O
day O
after O

i B-PER:Individual
think O
because O
the O
day O

so O
fast O
and O
so O
suddenly O
in O
way O
. O

i B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
there O

been O
a O
pattern O
here O
not O
just O
with O
this B-ORG:Government

, O
but O
over O
the O
last O
ten O
years O
, O
bosnia B-GPE:Nation
, O
kosovo B-GPE:State-or-Province

afghanistan B-GPE:Nation

where B-GPE:Nation
we B-PER:Group
do O
n't O
quite O
recognize O
when O
the O
old O
order O

, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
very O
quickly O

fill O
it O
with O
some O
kind O
of O
new O

in O
the O
short O

, O
that O
's O
going O
to O
have O
to O
mean O
the B-ORG:Government
american I-ORG:Government
military I-ORG:Government
. O

but O
the O
key O
question O
, O
which O
i B-PER:Individual
try O
to O
address O
in O
the O
book O
, O
is O
what O
do O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
do O
after O
that O
? O

what O
kind O
of O
authority O
do O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
create O
in O
a B-PER:Group
society I-PER:Group
going O
through O
this O
kind O
of O

. O

and O
how O
do O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
know O
that O
the B-PER:Group
local I-PER:Group
iraqi I-PER:Group
citizens I-PER:Group
will O
make O
up O
this B-GPE:Nation
government I-GPE:Nation
or O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
interested O
in O
democracy O
? O

there O
's O
no O
proof O
of O
that O
. O

well O
, O
the O
key O
here O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
get O
that B-GPE:Nation
kind I-GPE:Nation
of I-GPE:Nation
legitimate I-GPE:Nation
government I-GPE:Nation
to O
have O
it B-GPE:Nation
look O
good O
is O
to O
hold O
elections O
. O

but O
if O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
hold O
elections O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
stop O
the O
whole O
process O
of O
building O
a O
rule O
of O

, O
creating O

, O
creating O

. O

we B-PER:Group
've O
seen O
in O
the O
past O
in O
bosnia B-GPE:Nation
for O
example O
, O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
held O
elections O
and O
all B-PER:Group
of I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
old I-PER:Group
ethnic I-PER:Group
thugs I-PER:Group
get O
into O
power O
because O
they B-PER:Group
have O
organization O
and O
they B-PER:Group
have O
money O
and O
they B-PER:Group
stop O
the O
process O
of O
genuine O
building O
of O
democracy O
. O

there O
is O
this O
tension O
here O
which O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
make O
this O
look O
good O
is O
in O
some O
way O
get O
legitimate B-GPE:Nation
iraqi I-GPE:Nation
authority I-GPE:Nation
, O
but O
the O
faster O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
get O
that O
, O
the O
more O
likely O
you B-PER:Indeterminate
stop O
this O
process O
. O

so O
what O
do O
you B-PER:Individual
think O
of O
this B-GPE:Nation
interim I-GPE:Nation
government I-GPE:Nation
? O

you B-PER:Individual
got O

that O

setting O

and O
then O
later O
draw O
civilians B-PER:Group
into O
the O
process O
. O

is O
that O
going O
to O
work O
? O

i B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
will O
work O
if O
it O
