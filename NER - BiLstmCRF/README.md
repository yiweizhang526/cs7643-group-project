# Codes and Datasets

The original ACE 2005 dataset is very huge so I uploaded the preprocessed dataset. Thanks to the preprocessing repo: [Clearailhc/ACE2005-toolkit: Focusing on ACE 2005 data preprocessing, we provide doc-level, sentence-level and BIO-style golden data preprocessing, the only thing you need is the ACE05 row data. Hope you enjoy!ðŸ˜Ž (github.com)](https://github.com/Clearailhc/ACE2005-toolkit)

I added BIO label to the corpus accordingly.
