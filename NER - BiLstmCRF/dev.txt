Everyone B-PER:Group
has O
heard O
the O
story O
: O
Beatriz B-PER:Individual
Marinello I-PER:Individual
was O
elected O
USCF B-Job-Title
President I-Job-Title
on O
August O
11 O
, O
2003 O
in O
Los B-GPE:Population-Center
Angeles I-GPE:Population-Center
. O

Immediately O
after O
she B-PER:Individual
took O
office O
, O
she B-PER:Individual
found O
out O
that O
the B-ORG:Sports
USCF I-ORG:Sports
had O
no O
money O
in O
the B-ORG:Commercial
bank I-ORG:Commercial
, O
zero O
. O

The B-ORG:Sports
USCF I-ORG:Sports
did O
not O
even O
have O
the O
money O

the O

at O
the O

Therefore O
, O
on O
August O
20 O
, O
2003 O
, O
bravely O
Beatriz B-PER:Individual
walked O
into O
the B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
USCF I-FAC:Subarea-Facility

in I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
New I-FAC:Subarea-Facility

. O

John B-PER:Individual
McCrary I-PER:Individual
resigned O
from O
the B-PER:Group
board I-PER:Group
as O
a O
result O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
just O
a O
pure O
coincidence O
that O
the B-PER:Group
17 I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
Beatriz I-PER:Group
fired I-PER:Group
were O
the B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group

had I-PER:Group

that I-PER:Group

worked I-PER:Group
for I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
USCF I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
1999-2000 I-PER:Group
. O

It O
took O
six O
weeks O
before O

paid O
the O
guaranteed O
prizes O
the B-PER:Group
prize I-PER:Group
winners I-PER:Group
had O
won O
at O
the O
US B-GPE:Nation
Open O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
have O
just O
found O
out O
something O
that O
insiders B-PER:Group
had O
known O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The B-ORG:Sports
USCF I-ORG:Sports
did O
not O
have O
zero O
money O
in O
the B-ORG:Commercial
bank I-ORG:Commercial
. O

It B-ORG:Sports
had O
$ B-Numeric:Money
85,000 I-Numeric:Money
in O
another O
bank B-ORG:Commercial
account O
that O
nobody B-PER:Individual
knew O
about O
. O

This O
was O
not O
due O
to O
any O
malfeasance O
. O

The B-PER:Individual
office I-PER:Individual
accountant I-PER:Individual
for I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
USCF I-PER:Individual
had O
set O
up O
a O
separate O
bank O
account O
and O
had O
put O
the O
entry O
fees O
from O
the O
US B-GPE:Nation

Nobody B-PER:Individual
knew O
about O
that O
separate O
bank B-ORG:Commercial
account O
, O
except O
for O
the B-PER:Individual
accountant I-PER:Individual
herself I-PER:Individual
. O

When O
this O
was O
discovered O
, O
the B-PER:Individual
accountant I-PER:Individual
explained O
that O
she B-PER:Individual
was O
planning O
to O
keep O
the O
money O
in O
that O
account O
until O
the O
tournament O
was O
closed O
out O
. O

Perhaps O
the B-PER:Individual
accountant I-PER:Individual
was O
following O
a O
procedure O
followed O
by O
the B-ORG:Sports
USCF I-ORG:Sports
for O
scholastic O
tournaments O
. O

At O
scholastic O
tournaments O
, O
no O
cash O
prizes O
are O
paid O
. O

However O
, O
in O
adult B-PER:Group
tournaments O
, O
the B-PER:Group
players I-PER:Group
expect O
to O
receive O
their B-PER:Group
prizes O
, O
and O
to O
receive O
them O
immediately O
. O

For O
this O
act O
of O
stupidity O
which O
had O
caused O
a O
grave O
crisis O
in O
the B-ORG:Sports
USCF I-ORG:Sports
, O
the B-PER:Individual
accountant I-PER:Individual
was O
immediately O
fired O
. O

Had O
the O
existence O
of O
this O
$ B-Numeric:Money
85,000 I-Numeric:Money
in O
a O
secret O

account O
been O
known O
, O
it O
would O
not O
have O
been O
necessary O
to O
fire O
those B-PER:Group
17 I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
right O
away O
. O

Perhaps O
in O
the O
long O
run O
it O
was O
a O
good O
thing O
to O
fire O
them B-PER:Group
, O
but O
it O
might O
not O
have O
been O
a O

And O
, O
of O

that O

what O
happened O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
just O
had O
no O
idea O
that O

would O
see O
it O
as O

Not O
only O
was O

adequate O

we B-ORG:Sports

for O

It O

some O
sort O
of O

the O

I B-PER:Individual
do O

if O
this O

so O
, O
and O
I B-PER:Individual
really O
think O
it O
's O
sort O
of O
irrelevant O
. O

It O
's O
irrelevant O
because O
the O
REAL O
question O
is O
whether O
an B-PER:Individual
active I-PER:Individual

member I-PER:Individual
can O
, O
while O

Of O

it O

in O

that O

not O
be O

It O
ought O
to O
be O
pretty O
obvious O
that O
it O
would O
be O
entirely O
contrary O
to O
the O
spirit O
of O
this O
for O
an B-PER:Individual
active I-PER:Individual
board I-PER:Individual
member I-PER:Individual
to O
be O
money O
after O
leaving O
the B-PER:Group
board I-PER:Group
. O

Suppose O
, O
for O
example O
, O
there O
were O
to O
be O
a O
proposal O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
each B-PER:Individual
EB I-PER:Individual
member I-PER:Individual
would O
be O
given O
$ B-Numeric:Money
10,000 I-Numeric:Money
upon O
the O
expiration O
of O
his B-PER:Individual
/ O
her B-PER:Individual
term O
. O

Clearly O
this O
would O
be O
a O
transparent O
attempt O
to O
evade O
the O
bylaws O
and O
would O
fail O
. O

If O
the B-PER:Group
board I-PER:Group
can O
not O

to O
give O

money O
, O
they B-PER:Group
can O
not O

either O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
whether O
this O
arrangement O
is O
embodied O
in O
an O
EB B-PER:Group
vote O
or O
not O
, O
or O
whether O
the O
discussion O
of O
the O
proposal O
takes O
place O
in O
a O
formal O
EB B-PER:Group

not O

A B-PER:Individual
board I-PER:Individual

, O

new I-PER:Group
EB I-PER:Group
that I-PER:Group
would I-PER:Group
consider I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
issues I-PER:Group
objectively I-PER:Group
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
someone B-PER:Individual
could O
leave O
the B-PER:Group
board I-PER:Group
-without O
- O
ever O
having O
discussed O
being O
compensated O
by O
the B-PER:Group
board I-PER:Group
in O
the O
future O
, O
and O
that O
then O
the B-PER:Group
remaining I-PER:Group
members I-PER:Group
could O
, O
for O
good O
reason O
, O
hire O
that B-PER:Individual
person I-PER:Individual
. O

It O
would O
create O
questions O
among O
the B-PER:Group
suspicious I-PER:Group
- O
and O
avoiding O
this O
appearance O
of O
wrongdoing O
would O
be O
another O
good O
reason O
for O
a O
time O
limit O
- O
but O
it O
would O
n't O
automatically O
be O
an O
ethics O
or O
bylaws O
violation O
. O

But O
this O
is O
neither O
here O
nor O
there O
, O
because O
the O
fact O
that O
Randy B-PER:Individual
Bauer I-PER:Individual
is O
already O
talking O
about O
Beatriz B-PER:Individual
Marinello I-PER:Individual
as O
the B-PER:Individual
USCF I-PER:Individual
's I-PER:Individual
new I-PER:Individual
" I-PER:Individual
move I-PER:Individual
coordinator I-PER:Individual
" I-PER:Individual
, O
whatever O
that O
involves O
, O
and O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
means O
that O
she B-PER:Individual
would O
be O
the B-PER:Individual
de I-PER:Individual
facto I-PER:Individual
interim I-PER:Individual
ED I-PER:Individual
, O
means O
that O
at O
some O
level O
and O
in O
some O
form O
these O
discussions O
HAVE O
already O
taken O
place O
, O
while O
Marinello B-PER:Individual
is O
serving O
as O
President B-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
mean O
, O
it O
's O
conceivable O
that O
the B-PER:Group
other I-PER:Group
six I-PER:Group
have O
all O
gotten O
together O
in O
Marinello B-PER:Individual
's O
absence O
and O
drafted O
her B-PER:Individual
, O
but O
it O
also O
seems O
pretty O
clear O
that O
she B-PER:Individual
has O
agreed O
to O
do O
it O
, O
and O
, O
if O
all O
the O
rumors O
are O
true O
and O
she B-PER:Individual
steps O
down O
, O
it O
will O
be O
so O
that O
she B-PER:Individual
can O
take O
on O
these O
new O
responsibilities O
. O

So O
the O
' O
time O
limit O
' O
issue O
does O
n't O
even O
come O
up O
. O

We B-PER:Group
pretty O
much O
know O
that O
Marinello B-PER:Individual
, O
while O
on O
the B-PER:Group
board I-PER:Group
, O
has O
arranged O
to O
get O
future O
money O
from O
the B-ORG:Sports
USCF I-ORG:Sports
. O

So O
we B-PER:Group
already O
have O
a O
problem O
. O

If O
this O
is O
NOT O
a O
problem O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
wish O
someone B-PER:Individual
would O
explain O
to O
me B-PER:Individual
why O
not O
. O

Now O
, O
Stan B-PER:Individual
B. I-PER:Individual
argues O
that O
Marinello B-PER:Individual
's O
services O
are O
in O
fact O
indispensible O
as O
move B-PER:Individual
coordinator I-PER:Individual
, O
and O
that O
ethics O
standards O
are O
not O
a O
suicide O
pact O
, O
so O
that O
since O
we B-PER:Group
absolutely O
NEED O
her B-PER:Individual
the B-PER:Group
EB I-PER:Group
has O
the O
right O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
retain O
her B-PER:Individual
. O

I B-PER:Individual
agree O
with O
the O
principle O
. O

But O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
to O
make O
this O
argument O
work O
the B-PER:Group
EB I-PER:Group
would O
have O
to O
produce O
some O
evidence O
that O
Marinello B-PER:Individual
really O
IS O
indispensible O
for O
this O
task O
. O

This O
would O
have O
to O
include O
evidence O
that O
the B-PER:Group
EB I-PER:Group
had O
considered O
all O
the O
alternatives O
, O
including O
: O

- O
delegating O
the O
whole O
thing O
to O
the B-PER:Individual
Interim I-PER:Individual
ED I-PER:Individual
, O
which O
would O
be O
the O
normal O
practice O
in O
normal B-ORG:Non-Governmental
organizations I-ORG:Non-Governmental
with I-ORG:Non-Governmental
an I-ORG:Non-Governmental
ED I-ORG:Non-Governmental

- O
asking O
the B-PER:Individual
Interim I-PER:Individual
ED I-PER:Individual
to O
designate O
someone B-PER:Individual
from I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
New I-PER:Individual
Windsor I-PER:Individual
staff I-PER:Individual
to O
act O
as O
move B-Job-Title
coordinator I-Job-Title

- O
asking O
the B-PER:Individual
Interim I-PER:Individual
ED I-PER:Individual
to O
hire O
some B-PER:Individual
other I-PER:Individual
consultant I-PER:Individual
with I-PER:Individual
experience I-PER:Individual
in I-PER:Individual
office I-PER:Individual
relocation I-PER:Individual
to O
manage O
the O
job O
( O
there O
are O
such B-PER:Individual
people I-PER:Individual
) O

- O
conducting O
some O
kind O
of O
actual O
search O
for O
candidates B-PER:Group
for I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
position I-PER:Group
during O
the O
last O
two O
months O
since O
the O
move O
was O
decided O
upon O

If O
they B-PER:Group
did O
consider O
alternatives O
, O
it O
would O
also O
have O
to O
include O
evidence O
that O
Marinello B-PER:Individual
has O
much O
more O
experience O
at O
relocating O
offices B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
than O
other B-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
, O
or O
is O
willing O
to O
do O
the O
job O
cheaper O
( O
although O
this O
would O
n't O
constitute O
being O
" O
indispensible O
" O
in O
my B-PER:Individual
view O
) O
. O

If O
, O
however O
, O
they B-PER:Group
just O
looked O
around O
the B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
room I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
and O
said O
" O
who B-PER:Individual
is O
going O
to O
manage O
this O
? O
" O

and O
someone B-PER:Individual
said O
, O
" O
Beatriz B-PER:Individual
, O
how O
about O
you B-PER:Individual
? O
" O
, O
this O
does O
not O
constitute O
proof O
that O
her B-PER:Individual
services O
are O
indispensible O
, O
and O
thus O
it O
would O
n't O
interfere O
with O
my B-PER:Individual
belief O
that O
there O
has O
been O
an O
ethics O
violation O
and O
a O
bylaws O
violation O
. O

One O
very O
bad O
argument O
that O
was O
made O
by O
Kevin B-PER:Individual
Bachler I-PER:Individual
, O
which O
to O
be O
fair O
was O
surrounded O
by O
arguably O
better O
ones O
, O
was O
that O
since O
this B-PER:Group
board I-PER:Group
was O
elected O
, O
we B-ORG:Sports
should O
let O
them B-PER:Group
do O
as O
they B-PER:Group
please O
. O

Which O
is O
to O
say O
that O
there O
might O
as O
well O
not O
be O
bylaws O
, O
ethics O
standards O
, O
laws O
, O
etc. O
, O
since O
an B-PER:Group
elected I-PER:Group
board I-PER:Group
is O
not O
bound O
by O
any O
of O
them O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
this O
idea O
should O
be O
rejected O
. O

Another O
argument O
, O
which O
is O
better O
but O
still O
disturbing O
, O
is O
that O
, O
yes O
, O
this O
is O
an O
ethics O
violation O
, O
and O
maybe O
worse O
, O
but O
it O
would O
only O
hurt O
the B-ORG:Sports
USCF I-ORG:Sports
to O
talk O
about O
it O
, O
and O
that O
only O
troublemakers B-PER:Group
like O
Sam B-PER:Individual
Sloan I-PER:Individual
, O
Larry B-PER:Individual
Parr I-PER:Individual
, O
and O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
suppose O
, O
me B-PER:Individual
, O
would O
talk O
about O
it O
, O
since O
doing O
so O
will O
obstruct O
the B-ORG:Sports
federation I-ORG:Sports
's O
plans O
, O
cause O
us B-ORG:Sports
to O
pay O
legal O
expenses O
, O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
our B-ORG:Sports
being O
stuck O
without O
any B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
office I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
space I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
at I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
all I-FAC:Subarea-Facility
, O
cause O
people B-PER:Group
not O
to O
loan O
us B-ORG:Sports
money O
, O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

So O
we B-PER:Group
should O
all B-PER:Group
ignore O
this O
because O
it O
is O
realistic O
to O
do O
so O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
entirely O
unsympathetic O
to O
this O
, O
actually O
. O

But O
frankly O
I B-PER:Individual
think O
that O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
the O
problems O
the B-ORG:Sports
USCF I-ORG:Sports
has O
had O
over O
the O
years O
have O
had O
to O
do O
with O
well B-PER:Group
- I-PER:Group
intentioned I-PER:Group
people I-PER:Group
keeping I-PER:Group
secrets I-PER:Group
because I-PER:Group
bringing I-PER:Group
them I-PER:Group
out I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
open I-PER:Group
would I-PER:Group
harm I-PER:Group
the I-PER:Group
USCF I-PER:Group
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
we B-PER:Group
have O
awful O
habits O
which O
hurt O
the B-ORG:Sports
USCF I-ORG:Sports
even O
worse O
. O

But O
if O
we B-PER:Group
are O
going O
to O
talk O
about O
realism O
, O
here O
is O
another O
realistic O
concern O
: O

I B-PER:Individual
predict O
that O
, O
if O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
rumors O
about O
the O
agenda O
for O
the O
Florida B-GPE:State-or-Province
meeting O
prove O
true O
, O
and O
Marinello B-PER:Individual
resigns O
as O
President B-PER:Individual
and O
is O
hired O
as O
move B-PER:Individual
coordinator I-PER:Individual
, O
the O
immediate O
result O
of O
this O
is O
that O
Sam B-PER:Individual
Sloan I-PER:Individual
will O
file O
another O
lawsuit O
( O
or O
amend O
his B-PER:Individual
current O
complaint O

" O
Nothing O

Some B-PER:Group

as O
if O
the O
reason O
they B-PER:Group
are O

to O
go O
along O
with O
Bush B-PER:Individual
is O
because O
of O
the O

it O

Iran B-GPE:Nation

I B-PER:Individual
suspect O
the O
true O
reason O
for O
the O
reluctance O
comes O
not O
from O
the O
" O
delicate O

nature O
of O

but O
from O
the O

The B-ORG:Non-Governmental

a O
fax O
to O
Kofi B-ORG:Non-Governmental
Annan I-ORG:Non-Governmental
's I-ORG:Non-Governmental
office I-ORG:Non-Governmental
, O
saying O
he B-PER:Individual
had O
received O
evidence O
from O
a B-PER:Individual
Rwandan I-PER:Individual
government I-PER:Individual
informant I-PER:Individual
that O
genocide O
was O
being O
planned O
. O

The B-PER:Individual
informant I-PER:Individual
offered O
to O
help O
U.N. B-PER:Group
forces I-PER:Group
in O
raiding O
the B-WEA:Underspecified
government I-WEA:Underspecified
stockpiles I-WEA:Underspecified
to O
be O
used O
in O
the O
genocide O
campaign O
. O

All O
that O
the B-PER:Individual
informant I-PER:Individual
wanted O
in O
return O
was O
protection O
for O
himself B-PER:Individual
and O
his B-PER:Group
family I-PER:Group
. O

But O
the B-PER:Individual
general I-PER:Individual
needed O
U.N. B-ORG:Non-Governmental
authorization O
to O
conduct O
such O
a O
raid O
and O
save O
lives B-PER:Group
. O

He B-PER:Individual
asked O

approval O
but O
the O

It O

which B-ORG:Government
was O

The O
result O
was O
that O

. O

, O
Washington B-ORG:Media
Times I-ORG:Media
column O
, O
Nat B-PER:Individual

the B-ORG:Media
media I-ORG:Media

devoted O
" O
scant O
mention O
" O
to O
the O
" O
plain O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
Mr. B-PER:Individual
Annan I-PER:Individual
, O
when O
he B-PER:Individual
was O
head B-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
the I-PER:Individual
United I-PER:Individual
Nation I-PER:Individual

who B-ORG:Non-Governmental
could O
have O
prevented O
the O
slaughter O
of O
800,000 B-PER:Group
Tutsis I-PER:Group
and I-PER:Group
their I-PER:Group
sympathizers I-PER:Group
in I-PER:Group
Rwanda I-PER:Group
in O
1994 O
. O
" O

It O
's O
true O
, O
Hentoff B-PER:Individual
said O
, O
that O
the B-ORG:Non-Governmental
U.N. I-ORG:Non-Governmental
issued O
a O
report O
in O
1999 O
that O
acknowledged O
, O
to O
some O
extent O
, O
it B-ORG:Non-Governmental
s I-ORG:Non-Governmental
role O
in O
the O
killings O
. O

But O
for O
five O
and O
a O
half O
years O
, O
he B-PER:Individual
noted O
, O
Annan B-PER:Individual
" O
refused O
to O
accept O
any O
responsibility O
for O
the O
Rwandan B-GPE:Nation
holocaust O
until O
Mr. B-PER:Individual
Gourevitch I-PER:Individual
and O
others B-PER:Group
revealed O
that O
less B-PER:Group
than I-PER:Group
5,000 I-PER:Group
U.N. I-PER:Group
troops I-PER:Group
could O
have O
stopped O
the O
killings O
if O
Mr. B-PER:Individual
Annan I-PER:Individual
had O
not O
closed O
his B-PER:Individual
eyes O
. O
" O

It O
is O
astonishing O
that O
a B-PER:Individual
journalist I-PER:Individual
for I-PER:Individual
NBC I-PER:Individual
New I-PER:Individual
would O
close O
her B-PER:Individual
eyes O
to O
Annan B-PER:Individual
's O
role O
. O

But O
that O
is O
what O
she B-PER:Individual
was O
apparently O
paid O
to O
do O
. O

And O
so O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
have O
rejoined O
the O
world O
of O
the B-PER:Group
fully I-PER:Group
employed I-PER:Group
. O

After O
Christmas O
, O
I B-PER:Individual
got O
a O

from O
the B-PER:Individual
wife I-PER:Individual
of I-PER:Individual
one I-PER:Individual

at O

a O

it O

I B-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual

it O

the O

I B-PER:Individual

thus O

When O
I B-PER:Individual
was O
fulltime O
in O

I B-PER:Individual
made O
a O
little O
less O
, O
but O
I B-PER:Individual
got O
quite O
a O

which O
make O
up O

not O
getting O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
still O
doing O
my B-PER:Individual
TV O

my B-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual

going O

more O

work O
in O
the O
next O

, O
too O
. O

My B-PER:Individual
plan O
is O
to O
pay O

my B-VEH:Land

early O
, O
and O
then O
work O
on O
the O
other O

I B-PER:Individual
think O
it O
's O
time O
to O
go O
on O
and O
fill O
out O
the O

. O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
terrified O
of O
more O

, O
but O
Mom B-PER:Individual
and O
Dad B-PER:Individual
will O
help O
with O
the O
money O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
not O
sure O
they B-PER:Group
realize O
how O
expensive O
it O
all O
is O
. O

I B-PER:Individual
'm O
thinking O
we B-PER:Group
might O
lean O
toward O
adopting O
from O
Guatemala B-GPE:Nation
, O
but O
we B-PER:Group
've O
still O
not O
hashed O
it O
all O
out O
. O

It O
's O
almost O
bad O
making O
some O
money O
now O
, O
because O
while O
most O
of O
me B-PER:Individual
wants O
to O
save O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
the O
other O
, O
smaller O
part O
is O
screaming O
loudly O

, O

I B-PER:Individual
've O
got O
a O

because O
of O
the O
Dell B-ORG:Commercial

, O
and O
now O
I B-PER:Individual
'm O
lusting O
to O
have O
it O
all O
of O
the O

. O

G B-PER:Individual
got O
me O
a O
nice O
office B-FAC:Subarea-Facility
stereo O
for O
my B-PER:Individual
birthday O
and O
it O
does O
have O
an O

I B-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual
wanted O
a O

and O
I B-PER:Individual
said O
no O

but O
I B-PER:Individual
do O

many O

I B-PER:Individual

I B-PER:Individual
want O

of O

I B-PER:Individual
could O
get O
it O
now O
. O
